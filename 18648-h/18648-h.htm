<p style="text-align:center">INTRODUCTION TO THE<br/>TWILIGHT ANIMAL STORIES</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span class="smcap">By the Author</span></p>

<p>All little boys and girls who love animals should become acquainted with
Bumper the white rabbit, with Bobby Gray Squirrel, with Buster the bear,
and with White Tail the deer, for they are all a jolly lot, brave and
fearless in danger, and so lovable that you won't lay down any one of
the books without saying wistfully, "I almost wish I had them really and
truly as friends and not just storybook acquaintances." That, of course,
is a splendid wish; but none of us could afford to have a big menagerie
of wild animals, and that's just what you would have to do if you went
outside of the books. Bumper had many friends, such as Mr. Blind Rabbit,
Fuzzy Wuzz and Goggle Eyes, his country cousins; and Bobby Gray Squirrel
had his near cousins, Stripe the chipmunk and Webb the flying squirrel;
while Buster and White Tail were favored with an endless number of
friends and relatives. If we turned them all loose from the books, and
put them in a ten-acre lot&mdash;but no, ten acres wouldn't be big enough to
accommodate them, perhaps not a hundred acres.</p>

<p>So we will leave them just where they are&mdash;in the books&mdash;and read about
them, and let our imaginations take us to them where we can see them
playing, skipping, singing, and sometimes fighting, and if we read very
carefully, and <i>think</i> as we go along, we may come to know them even
better than if we went out hunting for them.</p>

<p>Another thing we should remember. By leaving them in the books, hundreds
and thousands of other boys and girls can enjoy them, too, sharing with
us the pleasures of the imagination, which after all is one of the
greatest things in the world. In gathering them together in a real
menagerie, we would be selfish both to Bumper, Bobby, Buster, White Tail
and their friends as well as to thousands of other little readers who
could not share them with us. So these books of Twilight Animal Stories
are dedicated to all little boys and girls who love wild animals. All
others are forbidden to read them! They wouldn't understand them if they
did.</p>

<p>So come out into the woods with me, and let us listen and watch, and I
promise you it will be worth while.</p>

<h2>STORY I<br/>WHERE BUMPER CAME FROM</h2>
</div>

<p>There was once an old woman who had so many rabbits that she hardly knew
what to do. They ate her out of house and home, and kept the cupboard so
bare she often had to go to bed hungry. But none of the rabbits suffered
this way. They all had their supper, and their breakfast, too, even if
there wasn't a crust left in the old woman's cupboard.</p>

<p>There were big rabbits and little rabbits; lean ones and fat ones;
comical little youngsters who played pranks upon their elders, and
staid, serious old ones who never laughed or smiled the livelong day;
boy rabbits and girl rabbits, mother rabbits and father rabbits, and
goodness knows how many aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, second
cousins and distant relatives-in-law! They all lived under one big roof
in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> backyard of the good old woman who kept them, and they had such
jolly times together that it seemed a shame to separate them.</p>

<p>But once every day the old woman chose several of her pets, and carried
them away in a basket to a certain street corner of the city where she
offered them for sale. She was dreadfully poor, and often when she
returned home at night, counting her money, she would murmur: "It's a
cabbage for them or a loaf of bread for myself. I can't get both."</p>

<p>She didn't always get the loaf of bread, but the rabbits always had
their cabbage. They were all pink-eyed, white rabbits, and people were
willing to pay good prices for them. But the whitest and pinkest-eyed of
them all was Bumper, a tiny rabbit when he was born, and not very big
when the old woman took him away on his first trip to the street corner.
Bumper had never seen so many people before, and he was a little shy and
frightened at first; but Jimsy and Wheedles, his brothers, laughed at
his fears, and told him not to mind.</p>

<p>After that he plucked up courage, and when a little girl suddenly ran
out of the crowd and picked him up in her arms, he tried not to be
afraid. "Oh, you sweet little thing!" the girl exclaimed, pinching his
ears softly. "Where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> did you come from, and where did you get those pink
eyes and those long, fluffy ears?"</p>

<p>Then the girl kissed Bumper and rubbed his nose against her soft, fresh
young cheek; but when the old lady approached, all smiles, and said,
"Want him, dear?" she put him down in the basket again.</p>

<p>"Want him? Of course, I want him!" she replied a little scornfully. "But
I can't buy him to-day. I spent all my birthday money on candies and
cakes. Take him now before I steal him and run away."</p>

<p>She was a pretty girl, with red hair, a dimple in her chin, and one big
freckle on the end of her nose; but her eyes were blue, and they made
Bumper think of the sky which he could see through a hole in the roof of
his house. I suppose it was because he had pink eyes that he thought
blue was so becoming to little girls.</p>

<p>That night when he got home, Bumper was bursting with excitement. The
day's experience was enough to cause this, but the words of the little
girl who had spent all of her birthday money for candies and cakes were
fresh in his mind. The first thing he did when he got in his box was to
pester his mother with so many questions that she had hard work
answering them.</p>

<p>"A little girl asked me where I came from,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> mother, and I couldn't
answer her. Where did I come from?"</p>

<p>"Why, dear, from a snowball, of course. How else could you be so white?"</p>

<p>"And have I pink eyes?" That was the little girl's second question.</p>

<p>"What color did you think they were?" asked Bumper's mother, smiling.
"Look at the eyes of your brothers and sisters."</p>

<p>Bumper looked in Jimsy's and Wheedle's eyes, and saw they were pink, but
he was still doubtful. "But mine," he added, "are you sure they're pink?
They might be green or yellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mother rabbit laughed and hopped over to a basin of water which the good
old woman kept filled for her pets. "Look in that," she said, "and then
tell me what you see."</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement, Bumper plunged both front paws in the basin,
and the water rippled in little waves so that he could see nothing. He
was terribly disappointed at first, for the water was a little dirty,
and he was afraid the black specks floating in it might be the
reflection of his eyes. Then the water cleared as the dirt settled at
the bottom, and straight up from the depths there glowed two tiny pink
spots. Bumper watched them in silence until his mother asked: "What do
you see, dear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two pink stars!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Mother rabbit, like all fond mothers, smiled and leaned over to kiss the
wet nose of her little one. Jimsy and Wheedles and all the other rabbits
were anxious to see the two pink stars in the water, and they crowded
around the basin to get a look. They held their breath in amazement, for
wonder of wonders! instead of two, there were a dozen tiny pink stars!
They twinkled and flashed, and when they bobbed their heads up the stars
faded away or disappeared entirely.</p>

<p>Mother rabbit, who was very fond of her little ones, smiled proudly, and
said:</p>

<p>"All my children have pink eyes!"</p>

<p>"But don't all rabbits have pink eyes?" asked Bumper, whose little brain
was still bursting with questions.</p>

<p>"No, dear, they do not&mdash;only those rabbits that come from snowballs have
pink eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed one and all, and particularly Bumper, who had started
all this probing into the family history.</p>

<p>Then the last question of the little girl popped up into his head, and
without waiting to catch his breath, or to give his mother time to think
up a suitable answer, he blurted it out.</p>

<p>"Where did I get these long, fluffy ears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> mother? The little girl said
they were long and fluffy."</p>

<p>Just to make sure he had not been deceived, he pulled them right down
between his two front paws, and looked at them. They were, indeed, long,
silky and fluffy, and as white as snow.</p>

<p>Mother rabbit shook her head slowly just as if she intended to scold,
and then said in the softest, gentlest of voices:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that little girl has been putting vain ideas into your head,
dear. You must be careful, and not let compliments about your eyes and
ears spoil you. If you do people won't like you."</p>

<p>Bumper promised not to be spoilt by listening to what little girls said,
and then eagerly repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Why, that is simple enough," Mother rabbit answered, having had time to
think. "When you were only a little snowball, we had to hang you up to
dry, and that pulled your ears out."</p>

<p>That was an answer good enough for any rabbit, and Bumper should have
been satisfied, but he had a very inquisitive mind.</p>

<p>"But why didn't I melt when I was hung up to dry?" he asked quickly.
"Snowballs melt in the sun, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," gravely, "so they do, dear, if you leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> them in the sun too
long. But it was mother's business to see that you didn't melt. It's
like baking bread or cake. If you leave the dough in the oven too long
it burns up, and then it isn't either bread or cake. It's very hard to
know just when it's done, and it's harder"&mdash;sighing aloud&mdash;"for mothers
to know just when a snowball is turning into a white rabbit, and when
it's beginning to melt away into nothing. Now don't ask me any more
questions to-night. It's bed time, and little rabbits with pink eyes
should be fast asleep."</p>

<p>Which was true, but Bumper went to sleep dreaming of a million questions
he would ask his mother in the morning.</p>

<h2>STORY II<br/>WHY BUMPER WAS LEFT AT HOME</h2>
</div>

<p>Bumper woke up the next morning so hungry that he couldn't think of any
of the million questions to ask until he'd finished eating his
breakfast. Besides a cabbage, there were some carrots and beet tops the
old woman had fished out of a grocer's backyard, and Bumper had to jump
lively to get his share. Jimsy and Wheedles were already on their second
carrot when he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"You'll never catch up with me!" said Jimsy, greedily. "I'm one carrot
ahead of you."</p>

<p>"And I'm one and a half," mumbled Wheedles, with his mouth full.</p>

<p>"I don't care. Sleep is better for you than so much eating. I had a
longer nap, and such beautiful dreams! Oh, I do hope some of them will
come true."</p>

<p>"Tell us about them," said Jimsy, forgetting to eat. "I never have
dreams."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," complained Wheedles. "You must tell us about your
dreams."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as I finish my breakfast I will," replied Bumper. "Yes, they
were beautiful dreams! I thought I was in a big place filled with crisp
lettuce and golden carrots, and a girl with red hair picked me up in her
arms and carried me away."</p>

<p>Bumper stopped talking while his brothers looked in amazement at him.
They had heard the day before his story of the red-haired girl who
wanted to buy him, and they were interested. But while they stopped and
waited for him to proceed, Bumper chewed away at his carrot until it was
all gone. Then, picking up a second one, he said: "Now I'm up with you.
I'm on my second carrot. To-morrow morning I'll tell you the rest of the
dream."</p>

<p>Jimsy and Wheedles were greatly surprised and angered at the trick
Bumper had played upon them, and they immediately began eating their
carrots again as fast as they could.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of their breakfast when the old woman came in the
backyard with her basket. All the rabbits set up a commotion then, for
they knew she would choose some of them to take away and sell. There
were two reasons why they all wanted to be chosen.</p>

<p>One was they liked the change from their narrow quarters to the street
corner and the sights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> of the city. Another was they all hoped some day
to be sold and taken away to a big house where they would be petted and
fed until their little stomachs would nearly burst open. They were a
little crowded in their home, and new baby rabbits were coming all the
time so that if some of them weren't sold they'd soon be walking all
over each other.</p>

<p>"Now, which ones shall I take to-day?" the old woman mumbled, smiling
upon all of them.</p>

<p>They all bobbed their heads and blinked their pink eyes, and Jimsy
jumped over Bumper's back and hopped right into the woman's hands.</p>

<p>"Well, Jimsy," she said, "you seem very anxious to go, so I'll take you
for one."</p>

<p>Wheedles tried the same trick, but it didn't work the second time. "No,
Wheedles, you've got a cold," she said, pushing him back. "People don't
want to buy rabbits that have colds."</p>

<p>Bumper had no cold, and he decided to try his luck, but Topsy, a big
rabbit, got in his way, and nearly bowled him over. Bumper squealed, and
the old woman pushed Topsy away.</p>

<p>"No, you can't go for being so rough," she scolded. "Poor little Bumper,
did Topsy hurt you?"</p>

<p>Bumper was sure then that she intended to take him along with Jimsy; but
no! she put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> him down gently, and selected three others. Bumper's
disappointment was so great that a tear came into one of his pink eyes.</p>

<p>It was mother who consoled him when the old woman had filled her basket
and left the yard. "Never mind, dear, your time will come. You're
younger than Jimsy."</p>

<p>"But why should I always be left at home?" complained Bumper.</p>

<p>"It's the place for little rabbits," was the reply. "There's no place so
safe and comfortable."</p>

<p>"But you always told us some day we'd find a better home, with plenty to
eat, and nothing to do," whimpered Bumper, who felt quite cross. "Why
did you tell us that?"</p>

<p>Mother rabbit looked quite perplexed for a moment. "I think, dear," she
said finally, "you ask more questions than any child I ever had."</p>

<p>Bumper's eyes shone with amusement. "I have a million more of them to
ask, mother. I dreamt of them last night."</p>

<p>"Then," laughing at him, "find the answers to them in your dreams
to-night."</p>

<p>The next day Bumper had his turn, and then again the following day, but
each time he returned home unsold. Jimsy was bought by a little boy, and
triumphantly carried off, and Wheedles was captured by a girl. Even
Topsy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> who was big and clumsy, found a purchaser, and disappeared from
the backyard. On returning home the fourth time, Bumper was in a
disappointed mood, and felt very unhappy.</p>

<p>"Why is it, mother," he asked, "that no one buys me? Am I so homely that
no one wants me?"</p>

<p>"What a question to ask, dear!" smiled mother rabbit. Then, patting him
on the head, she added: "Bend down your ears, and I'll whisper a secret
in them."</p>

<p>Bumper squatted down, and pulled both long ears toward his mother so he
wouldn't miss a word.</p>

<p>"It isn't good for little rabbits to hear what I'm going to tell you,"
she whispered. "It often makes them proud and vain; but I suppose you
will know it some day."</p>

<p>Mother rabbit sighed, as if the secret was hard to tell, and not very
pleasant to hear. Mothers are very queer sometimes, even rabbit mothers.</p>

<p>"It's because you're so beautiful, dear!" she whispered finally. "You're
whiter than any of my children, and you have the softest fur, and the
pinkest eyes. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>No, Bumper didn't understand a bit. He was more perplexed than ever. If
he was handsomer than other white rabbits, then why didn't people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> buy
him first? Why did they look at him, and return him to the basket, and
say:</p>

<p>"I guess I'll take the other one?"</p>

<p>"It must be people don't know how pretty I am," he said finally. "What
can I do to make them see?"</p>

<p>Mother rabbit laughed until her fat sides wobbled like a fur muff filled
with playful kittens. "Dear, dear," she exclaimed, with tears in her
eyes. "I thought you would understand. It's because the people don't
have the money to give."</p>

<p>"Why don't they?" he asked, a little peeved. "Don't they have all the
money they want?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, not all of them. Some are nearly as poor as we are, and they
have to be careful of the pennies. That's why they don't buy you. The
old woman asks too much for you."</p>

<p>This didn't improve Bumper's temper any; but right away he thought of
the little girl with the red hair. "Do you think she has plenty of
money?" he asked. "She was beautifully dressed, and had a rose in her
hair."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Some people put all their money on their backs, and
starve their stomachs. It may be this girl was that kind."</p>

<p>Bumper was sure she was wrong, for the red-haired girl didn't look
starved; but she didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> have any of her birthday money left, and she
confessed she'd spent it all for cakes and candies. Bumper wondered if
she'd had anything to eat since, or if she was saving up her money to
buy him.</p>

<p>That night he had another dream in which the red-haired girl appeared;
but in the morning the old woman took him out of the box, and said:
"It's your turn, Bumper. I must sell you to-day. I need the money
badly."</p>

<h2>STORY III<br/>BUMPER IS SOLD</h2>
</div>

<p>Bumper was taken to the street corner with Fluffy, Dimples and Pickles.
It was a cloudy day, and the old woman limped as she walked along with
her basket on her arm. Damp weather always brought out her rheumatism,
and sometimes made her very cross.</p>

<p>Dimples and Fluffy began playing they were on a ship in a storm, and
when a drop of rain hit Pickles on the nose he squealed with delight,
and joined them in the game. They scampered around so lively inside that
the old woman stopped and opened the cover of the basket.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" she said quite angrily, "or I'll dump you all in the
gutter!"</p>

<p>The threat was enough to send each to a corner of the basket, where they
eyed each other and tried to think up some less boisterous game. It was
beginning to rain steadily outside, and the water trickled through the
top of the basket. Every time a drop hit one, he squealed, but no one
dared to jump and run around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Now rabbits don't sell very well on rainy days, especially white
rabbits. Their fur gets all wet and roughened up, and they look more
like half-drowned rats than pretty, fluffy bunnies. Fluffy was taken out
of the basket first, but nobody took any notice of her, and when she
came back she was all wet and shivery.</p>

<p>"B-r-r-r, it's awfully wet outside," she said, shaking with the cold.
"I'm glad nobody bought me, for I'd rather be in here safe and warm than
in somebody's arms."</p>

<p>Pickles's turn came next. He had an ingrowing toe nail, which sometimes
made him grouchy and sour, so he was dubbed Pickles. He looked and acted
like his name now. He squealed when the old woman picked him up in her
hand, and when a splash of rain landed on the back of his neck he kicked
both hind legs and wriggled his body free and fell plump back into the
basket.</p>

<p>The old woman was very angry. "You, Pickles," she growled, "you'll go to
bed to-night without any supper."</p>

<p>Somebody passed just then, a lady with an umbrella over her head, and
the woman with rabbits to sell turned to her in her most beguiling way.
"Rabbits, lady! Nice, pretty rabbits for sale!"</p>

<p>The lady stopped long enough to let her umbrella<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> drip all over the
basket, and then she asked: "Are they white rabbits? I don't want any
other kind."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'm, pure white bunnies, with pink eyes, and long, fluffy
ears&mdash;the dearest and cutest little things you ever saw. Let me show
you."</p>

<p>With that she made a grab in the basket. It was a blind-man's bluff
grab, for she couldn't see one of the rabbits huddling in the corners.
Bumper was the nearest, and her hand closed over him.</p>

<p>"That's the prettiest one I have, ma'm," she said. "He's my pet, an' I
hate to sell him, but I need the money an' you can have him."</p>

<p>It was raining pitchforks outside, or something like that, and, for a
moment, Bumper couldn't see anything but the big drops of water
splashing in his eyes. Then the lady held the umbrella over his head,
and he looked up into her face. She was a sweet, womanly lady, but not
exactly the kind of mistress Bumper had pictured belonging to.</p>

<p>"He is a dear little thing," the lady said, taking him in her arms and
rubbing his back. "And so friendly! Why, he's trying to cuddle up under
my arm."</p>

<p>The fact was, Bumper was trying to get in her muff away from the
dripping umbrella. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> made a dive for the nearest open end, and
squeezed all but his tail through.</p>

<p>"How cute of him! I believe I must take him. How much is he?"</p>

<p>Now Bumper's heart nearly stopped beating when he heard the lady ask
this question, for had not his mother told him that he cost too much
money for most people to buy? Did this lady have plenty of money, or did
she put it all on her back and starve her stomach? She was beautifully
dressed, and her cheeks were not very plump and fat&mdash;not a bit like
those of the red-headed girl with a freckle on the end of her nose.</p>

<p>"Two dollars, ma'm, an' he's cheap at that! You don't find rabbits like
him once in a year."</p>

<p>Bumper's hopes took a sudden drop. Two dollars! Why, Jimsy had been sold
for one dollar, and Wheedles for seventy-five cents, while Topsy, who
was old and fat, brought only fifty cents. My, two dollars was an awful
lot of money!</p>

<p>"Two dollars!" repeated the lady, fumbling in her dress with one hand.
Then, to Bumper's surprise and delight, she added: "I think I'll take
him. I want him for my nephew. Toby's hard to suit, but I think he'll be
pleased with a rabbit. What did you say you called him?"</p>

<p>"Bumper, ma'm!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a queer name, but I like it."</p>

<p>"It was because he was always bumping his nose when he was a tiny mite,"
the old woman explained, taking the two dollars from the lady. "His
mother named him first, and then his brothers and sisters took it up,
and, of course, I had to follow 'em. Rabbits don't like to be called by
two different names, and if I was you, ma'm, I'd keep on calling him
Bumper. He wouldn't know any other name."</p>

<p>"I will always call him Bumper, but"&mdash;sighing&mdash;"I'm afraid Toby will
want to nickname him. He makes up the funniest names for all his pets."</p>

<p>"Tell him then Bumper will run away and never come back. Rabbits are
more knowing than you think, ma'm."</p>

<p>"I always thought they were very cute and gentle, but very stupid,"
replied the lady. "But maybe I was wrong. Bumper doesn't look stupid."</p>

<p>"Lordy, ma'm! he ain't no more stupid than that Toby you speak of,
whoever he may be."</p>

<p>"Well, Toby isn't stupid, whatever else you may say of him," smiled the
lady. "He's bright enough, but he's sometimes very thoughtless, and I
fear a little cruel."</p>

<p>"Cruel, ma'm!" And the old woman who sold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> rabbits for a living
stiffened her bent form, and frowned. She stretched forth a hand as if
to reclaim her Bumper, but the lady moved away with her purchase under
her arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll see that he isn't cruel to Bumper," she said.</p>

<p>While listening to all this conversation, Bumper experienced strange and
unusual emotions. He had learned more about white rabbits in a few
moments than his mother had ever taught him in all the days of his
youth. They were considered stupid, were they?&mdash;but cute and gentle.
Huh! He wasn't stupid! No, indeed! If the lady thought so he'd show her
what a mistake she'd made.</p>

<p>Just to prove it, Bumper began to gnaw at the lining of the muff, and
pretty soon got his whole body under it, and then he began to kick and
wriggle to get out. He felt he was being smothered alive, and he
squealed aloud. The lady finally rescued him, but not until she had torn
away half the lining from her muff.</p>

<p>"Oh, you stupid little Bumper!" she said, reprovingly. "You mustn't do
such things!"</p>

<p>Bumper felt so crestfallen at this rebuke that he remained perfectly
quiet during the rest of the walk. He snuggled up into the crook of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
arm, and peeped out once only when they reached a big house and began
ascending the steps.</p>

<p>So this was to be his future home! What a big place it was! Why,
hundreds and hundreds of white rabbits could live in that house and
never lack for elbow room.</p>

<p>Just then, when Bumper began to feel a little proud about his future
home, a great noise and clatter behind the door startled him, and it
opened so suddenly that he nearly popped out of the lady's arms. And
what happened to him behind that door of the big house might fill
chapters and chapters, but it will all be told in the next story.</p>

<h2>STORY IV<br/>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DREADFUL HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p>When the door of the house flew open with a bang, the lady holding
Bumper put one hand to her heart, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, what has happened now!"</p>

<p>Bumper couldn't see any one in the dark, but evidently the lady could,
for a cool, quiet voice spoke to her.</p>

<p>"Toby threw his playthings down the stairs, and he's riding the
banisters with a tin pan for a hat. I suppose you heard the clatter of
the pan as it fell off."</p>

<p>"It sounded to me as if the house was falling down, Mary! I do wish Toby
would behave."</p>

<p>The one addressed as Mary laughed. She seemed like a pleasant, wholesome
young woman, with pink cheeks and smiling gray eyes. "I've told him to
behave a dozen times, but he won't mind. He's been cutting up all the
morning. But what have you there in your arms, Aunt Helen?"</p>

<p>"Guess, Mary. It's for Toby's birthday."</p>

<p>"Some kind of a toy, I suppose&mdash;or maybe a book."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"A book for Toby! What an idea! He'd throw it in the fire unless he
liked the pictures. No, it's something prettier and better than a book."</p>

<p>She opened her arms, and held Bumper forward so Mary could see him,
long, white ears and blinking eyes and all.</p>

<p>"Oh! A dear little rabbit!"</p>

<p>Before Bumper could protest or stop his heart from beating like a
trip-hammer, Mary seized him in both hands, and began gently stroking
his head.</p>

<p>"What a sweet little thing!" she murmured. "And so tame and friendly!"</p>

<p>Bumper was rubbing his wet nose against her velvety hands and thinking
how soft and pleasant they were to the touch.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's so tame he never once tried to jump out of my hands," replied
Aunt Helen. "I'm almost afraid to let Toby have him now that I've
brought him home. Do you think he'll be rough with him?"</p>

<p>Mary's face turned very grave and serious. "He's pretty young to have a
rabbit, Aunt Helen. If he should drop him&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;Well, we must teach
him to be very careful."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will speak to him myself."</p>

<p>You can imagine the state of Bumper's feelings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> by this time. Toby was
undoubtedly a cruel boy&mdash;Aunt Helen had said as much, and Mary had
confirmed it&mdash;and they were both afraid he was too young to own a pet
rabbit. What if he should drop him to the hard floor! Bumper peeked over
Mary's hands and looked below. The floor seemed a long distance away. If
he should fall it would very likely break a leg or his neck. Oh, why had
he been bought for a cruel boy's birthday present.</p>

<p>Bumper wanted to run and hide. If it hadn't been for the fear of falling
to the hard floor, he would have jumped out of Mary's hands and
scampered away. But he had no chance to do this. There was another loud
racketty-rack-clumpity-bang! First a big tin dish pan rolled all the way
down the stairs into the hall; then a set of building-blocks, a wooden
hobby horse, a lot of animals from a Noah's ark, tin soldiers, a drum,
and a train of cars. Toby came last, sliding down the banisters, and
shouting in glee as he landed at the bottom.</p>

<p>"It was a landslide, Auntie!" he shouted. "We all slid down the mountain
together."</p>

<p>"Toby, how many times have I told you not to do that!" reproved Mary,
while Aunt Helen turned pale and stood stock still.</p>

<p>Toby paid no attention to the rebuke. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> was a small, freckle-faced
boy. In one hand he held a whip, and in the other the broken head of a
wooden horse. He picked himself up, and began slashing his toys with the
whip. Bumper gave him one terrified glance, and made a desperate dive
for Mary's open waist. But Toby had sharp, bright eyes.</p>

<p>"What you got, Mary?" he shouted, running toward her, whip in hand. "Oh,
a rabbit! Yes, it is! You needn't hide him! I see him! It's a rabbit!
Let me have him!"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Toby, you'll tear my dress."</p>

<p>"Let me have him! He's mine."</p>

<p>"No, no, Toby, don't touch him. Wait! I'll show him to you!"</p>

<p>But Toby was much too spry for Mary or Aunt Helen. He darted around back
of them, and caught Bumper by the tail&mdash;and you know a rabbit's tail is
the smallest part of him&mdash;and began pulling it. Bumper let out a squeal,
and pulled the other way with all his might.</p>

<p>"I got him!" shrieked Toby gleefully. "I got him by the tail."</p>

<p>"Toby! Toby!" cried Mary, catching his hand. "Let go of him this
instant."</p>

<p>"I won't! I won't! He's mine!"</p>

<p>Between Toby pulling at one end, and Mary holding the other, Bumper felt
as if he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> part somewhere in the middle. He kicked with his hind
legs, and scratched Toby's hands, but the boy would not release his
hold. He gave a sharp jerk, and Bumper let out a squeal.</p>

<p>"You cruel, wicked boy!" exclaimed Mary, as Toby pulled the rabbit from
her arms, and swung him around by his hind legs. "Let me have him this
minute. You'll kill him!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't! He's mine! Isn't he, Aunt Helen? You brought him to me,
didn't you? There now, Mary, she nodded her head! I'm going to keep
him."</p>

<p>"But, dear, you must be very gentle with him," said Aunt Helen. "You'll
hurt him carrying him that way."</p>

<p>"That's the way to carry rabbits, by their hind legs," replied Toby. "I
saw them in the market the other day&mdash;a whole bunch of them&mdash;hanging by
their hind legs."</p>

<p>"But they were dead rabbits, Toby, and not live, white ones. Now let me
show you how to hold him."</p>

<p>But Toby was more interested in the experiment of making Bumper squeal
than in listening to his aunt's instructions. It was better than the
squeaking camel he had or the girl's doll that said mamma every time you
squeezed it. All he had to do was to squeeze the legs or swing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
rabbit around to make him squeal. Each time he laughed and shouted with
joy.</p>

<p>Mary could stand this cruel torture no longer. She made a dive for
Bumper, and caught him by the fore paws. In the struggle that followed
Bumper was likely to be pulled apart. What might have happened no one
could tell if the door had not suddenly opened, and a young girl, with
red hair and freckles on her nose, entered. She was humming some tune to
herself or to the doll she carried in her hands; but she stopped
singing, and stared at Toby and Mary pulling at the white rabbit.</p>

<p>Then she dropped her doll, and sprang forward to Bumper's rescue. "Oh,
that's my rabbit, cousin Mary!" she cried. "It's the one I wanted to buy
from the old woman, but I didn't have the money. Let go of him, Toby!
You're hurting him!"</p>

<p>"I won't! He's mine!" came the reply. "You let go of him!"</p>

<p>"He's not! He's mine!"</p>

<p>"He ain't! He's mine!"</p>

<p>"Stop that!" cried the girl, when Toby squeezed the legs so hard Bumper
whimpered with pain.</p>

<p>"I won't! I'll squeeze him all I want to."</p>

<p>To make good his word he gave the rabbit a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> harder squeeze. Then
something happened that surprised every one. The girl raised a hand, and
boxed Toby's ears so hard that it made him howl.</p>

<p>"Now, take that, and see how it feels to be hurt!"</p>

<p>Toby clapped both hands to his ears, and in a flash the red-headed girl
seized Bumper in her arms and ran pell-mell from the room. Toby started
after her, but when the door slammed in his face he flopped down on the
floor to howl and kick just like a baby who had eaten pickles instead of
good milk for breakfast.</p>

<h2>STORY V<br/>BUMPER AND THE RED-HEADED GIRL</h2>
</div>

<p>The red-headed girl, with the freckles on her nose, and a dimple in her
chin, didn't stop until she was on the top floor of the big house where
Toby's howls couldn't be heard. She opened the door of a dark room, and
went in, slamming and locking the door after her.</p>

<p>"There, now I guess he can't find us!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then to Bumper, she turned and began crooning: "You poor little rabbit!
Did Toby hurt you? Don't be frightened now. I won't let him have you
again. I'll buy you if it takes all my Christmas money. You're mine
now!"</p>

<p>You can never imagine how these words soothed Bumper's ruffled feelings.
It was like being rescued from a terrible giant who intended to dash out
your brains and eat you for supper. Bumper's heart began to beat slower
and slower until pretty soon it wasn't going any faster than the ticking
of the clock outside in the hallway.</p>

<p>They sat there in the dark room for a long time, the girl rubbing
Bumper's head and back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> and crooning gently to him. Then a noise
outside&mdash;the sound of approaching footsteps&mdash;alarmed the white rabbit
again.</p>

<p>"Edith!" a voice called. "Edith, are you up here?"</p>

<p>It was Mary, her cousin, calling, and the red-haired girl gently pushed
open the door, and whispered.</p>

<p>"I'm in here, cousin Mary. Where's Toby?"</p>

<p>"He's looking for you. I think you'd better get out of the house before
he finds you. Take Bumper with you, and we'll buy him something else to
keep him quiet."</p>

<p>"Then I can keep him?&mdash;call him really and truly mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can get away with him. Toby isn't old enough yet for pets."</p>

<p>"He's old enough," sniffed Edith, "but he's been spoilt, and don't know
how to treat them. If he ever lays hands on my rabbit again, I'll box
his ears so hard he'll never forget it. That's what I'll do!"</p>

<p>Mary seemed to concur in this, for she smiled, and rubbed Bumper's head
before adding. "He'd raise an awful howl, I suppose, if he knew you were
here. You'd better go home now. You can get through the backyard without
Toby seeing you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let him see me if he likes," retorted Edith, shaking her red curls and
tilting her freckled nose upward. "I won't let him have the rabbit. Aunt
Helen ought to spank him. That's what he deserves."</p>

<p>Mary walked ahead down the stairs to see if Toby was around, and then
when they reached the kitchen Edith climbed through an open window into
the backyard. There was a thick hedge around the yard, and back of that
another yard which smelt so sweet with flowers and green lawn that
Bumper raised his head and sniffed.</p>

<p>My, what a whiff that was! There was a vegetable garden hidden back of
the rose bushes, filled with crisp lettuce, golden carrots,
emerald-green cabbages, blood-red beets, blanching celery, peas, beans,
corn, potatoes, and green grass everywhere. It was a whiff from Rabbit
Arcady, and Bumper forgot all the dangers he had been through.</p>

<p>"No, no, you mustn't jump out of my arms!" warned Edith when he
struggled to get down and roll around in the green grass. "Toby might be
looking."</p>

<p>There was an opening in the thick hedge, and through this the red-haired
girl crawled into the second garden. If anything, this was a more
wonderful garden than the first. The odors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> were intoxicating. There
were flowers and birds and trees as well as succulent vegetables. A most
wonderful elm tree spread out like an umbrella and shaded the whole
lawn. Beneath this the girl stopped a moment, and let Bumper nibble at
the green grass.</p>

<p>For a city rabbit who had never seen green grass growing, and had only
tasted of vegetables several days or a week old, this visit to the
garden was like a foretaste of what all rabbits must consider heaven.
Nothing Bumper had ever eaten tasted quite so good as that grass, and
when the girl picked a fresh, crisp carrot from the garden he couldn't
believe it was anything but a magic carrot. It was so sweet and juicy
that it made his mouth water.</p>

<p>"Now you must come in the house," Edith said after he had eaten so much
that he was in danger of exploding like an over ripe tomato. "I'm going
to keep you right in my bedroom to-night. Then daddy will make a house
for you in the morning."</p>

<span class='caption'>He couldn't believe it was anything but a magic carrot</span>
</div>

<p>Bumper spent the night in a box lined with fresh, green grass at the
foot of the little girl's bed, but not until after he had met another
person whom he feared and disliked almost as much as the bad boy called
Toby. She was a cross old nurse, who looked after Edith, and she didn't
like <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>rabbits&mdash;not live ones. She admired Bumper's soft, white hair,
and remarked:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it make a handsome fur neck scarf? I wonder how much it would
cost."</p>

<p>Edith snatched the rabbit from her hands. "You wicked old thing!" she
exclaimed. "I believe you'd kill Bumper just for his fur."</p>

<p>"What a funny little girl you are," the nurse laughed. "What are rabbits
for if you can't use their skins for furs."</p>

<p>With that Edith clapped Bumper in the box, and sat on the lid. "I'm
going to sit there until you go," she said.</p>

<p>The nurse laughed, and when she finally left the room the red-haired
girl jumped up and locked the door. Then she patted Bumper again before
slipping in bed for the night.</p>

<p>It was early morning before the rabbit heard another word from her. The
moon peeking in through the window made Bumper feel quite at home, and
with it came the sweet aroma of that garden, intoxicating smells of
roses, green grass and succulent vegetables.</p>

<p>"Are you there, little Bumper?" the girl called just as the sun rose.
She was in her thin nightie, with her wonderful braids of red hair
streaming down her back. Bumper thumped on the box<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> with both hind feet
to express his delight at seeing her again.</p>

<p>"Now you're coming to bed with me," she added. And sure enough, she
lifted the white rabbit from the box and carried him to her bed. It was
soft and warm under the sheets, and Bumper began playing hide-and-seek
with her toes, making her shout and giggle every time his whiskers
rubbed against one. It must have been the noise they made that attracted
the nurse, for she suddenly knocked on the door and tried to open it.</p>

<p>Edith sprang out of bed, and put the rabbit in his box before she opened
the door. "Why was that door locked?" asked the nurse severely.</p>

<p>"Because," replied Edith saucily, "I didn't want you snooping in here in
the night to steal bunny."</p>

<p>"Well, of all things! If you ever do that again, I'll tell your mother!
Suppose the house took fire with you locked in here."</p>

<p>"I'd know enough to unlock the door, wouldn't I?" retorted the girl.</p>

<p>The nurse went to the bed and threw back the sheets to air them. Then,
in angry amazement, she exclaimed: "You've had that dirty beast in the
bed! Now don't tell me a story."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Nursy, and we had a beautiful time playing hide-and-seek under the
bedclothes."</p>

<p>The nurse stared hard at Edith, and then shook her head. "You're a
naughty girl, and I'll give the rabbit to Carlo. See if I don't?"</p>

<p>This didn't frighten the girl a bit, and she laughed in the nurse's
face; but it gave Bumper such a shock that he missed three heart beats
and one of his whiskers, for he knew Carlo was the dog he had heard
barking all night long.</p>

<h2>STORY VI<br/>BUMPER AND CARLO</h2>
</div>

<p>The little white rabbit found a home already waiting for him in the
prettiest corner of the garden, but before that the red-haired girl
harnessed him to a ribbon, and let him eat grass and vegetables to his
heart's content wherever he took a fancy to go. Edith lost her appetite
apparently in watching her pet eat, for she wouldn't go into breakfast
even after the nurse had called her several times; but finally, when her
mother came out, and took her by the hand, she obeyed.</p>

<p>"Can't I take the rabbit in with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, dear, put him in the pen over there. He'll be quite content alone."</p>

<p>So Bumper found himself alone in the garden, or rather in a pen shut off
from the rest of the garden by stout chicken wire. There was a box in
back of the pen, filled with soft grass and straw, and a tin pan filled
with fresh water. There was such a variety of things to eat that he kept
nibbling first a carrot, then a cabbage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> then a blade of grass, then
some corn, then a piece of bread, then some crackers, then a red beet,
then a spear of grass again, and so on through all the long list of good
things.</p>

<p>It was such a mixture that he was never sure just what he had in his
mouth. It was just as if a boy or girl had crammed the mouth full of gum
drops, chocolates, fudge, lollypops, taffy, peppermint, lemon and
wintergreen drops, and a few pieces of fruit cake by way of change. How
could he or she tell just what the teeth were munching on?</p>

<p>Bumper tasted them all, and thought that each one was sweeter and better
than the other; but when he got around to the end of his circle he had
to begin all over again to see if they didn't all taste better the
second time. My, it was a feast that made his eyes open and his stomach
swell like a toad's trying to swallow a gnat.</p>

<p>Edith came out so soon that Bumper knew right away that she hadn't eaten
much breakfast, and half of it was in her hands, and apparently the
other half was on her face instead of being in her stomach where it
should have been.</p>

<p>"Do you like bread and jam?" she asked, poking the bread she had been
eating at Bumper.</p>

<p>Like a well-bred rabbit, Bumper stuck his nose up and sniffed at the
dainty proffered him; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> when he got some of the jam on his nose he
hopped away and sneezed. It was gooseberry jam, and Bumper hated
gooseberries, although he had never tasted of them before.</p>

<p>"Oh, you funny bunnie!" exclaimed the girl. "Why don't you like jam?"</p>

<p>Then she caught a reflection of her face smeared with jam in the pan of
water, and she laughed happily. "I don't wonder you don't like it on
your face, Bumper," she said. "It does look awful, doesn't it? My, I
must have nearly a quart on my face."</p>

<p>Then she began cleaning her lips and chin, using Bumper's pan of water
for a wash basin. Bumper didn't object to this, but he did hope she'd
remember to change it, and give him clean water to drink. Even
gooseberry-jam-water wasn't to his liking.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Edith was carried away by the nurse for her
lessons, and then her music teacher appeared, and Bumper could hear her
fine, small voice singing in accompaniment to the piano. After that she
came into the garden again to play with him.</p>

<p>But she was soon called away to lunch, and then she had to go walking
with her mother, and it was nearly sundown when she returned. Her first
thought was of the rabbit, and she came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> running pell-mell across the
garden to greet him.</p>

<p>"Have you missed me, Bumper?" she asked, squatting down on the grass in
her new white dress. "I've been awfully lonely without you. I do hate
music lessons and visiting. I wish I could stay here all the time with
you, and maybe eat grass and green things, and grow fat and white like
you. I wonder how it feels to be a rabbit. Yes, I believe next to being
a little girl, I'd rather be a rabbit than anything else. Rabbits don't
have to work or study or sing or do anything. Goodness! what an easy
time you have of it."</p>

<p>Bumper thought so, too, and he began to swell up with pride. He was a
very young rabbit, and he was easily flattered. He wanted to tell her
that he would rather be a white rabbit than a girl with red hair, when
the nurse called Edith to dinner, and she had to leave him.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night, and Bumper wasn't a bit sleepy. What
rabbit could be in such a wonderful garden with the moon shining down
upon it. Bumper danced around in his small pen, and sat upon his hind
legs as if praying to the moon; but in reality he was trying to see how
high the wire fence was, and wondering if he could jump over it. He had
tried all day to nibble through it, and dig under it, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> the wire had
only hurt his teeth without giving way a particle. If he was going to
get out so he could run around the garden, he would have to do it by
jumping clear over the wire fence.</p>

<p>He tried it once, and fell short by several inches. He got a hard jolt
in doing it, and rubbed his head where it hit the earth. But the next
time he nearly reached the top.</p>

<p>"I can do it with a few more trials," he said, happy at the thought of
his freedom. "I'll surprise the little girl when she hunts for me in the
morning."</p>

<p>He hopped back a few feet, and then took a flying leap, and landed plump
on the top of the fence. The wire caught him in the middle of the
stomach, and there he hung for a moment undecided which way to fall. But
he kicked with his hind feet, and that seemed to upset his balance, for
he plunged headfirst down, and landed on the other side in a wild
somersault.</p>

<p>"Well, that wasn't exactly graceful," he said, "but I'm here, and that's
where I wanted to be. Now I'll explore the garden by moonlight."</p>

<p>First he ran to the vegetable garden, and nibbled at whatever he could
find; but he was really so full he couldn't eat much more. Then he
frisked around on the lawn, playing with his tail, and trying to jump as
high up in the air as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> he could. It was great fun, and Bumper panted
with joy.</p>

<p>Then suddenly out of the dark shadows of the garden something large,
fierce and frightfully noisy came bounding toward him. Bumper stood
stock still until a deep baying sound told him that it was Carlo, the
big dog, whose barking under the bedroom window had disturbed his sleep
the night before.</p>

<p>With a bound Bumper leaped over a rose bush, and started for his pen in
the corner, but Carlo took the bush in a powerful leap and made a grab
for his neck with his jaws. Bumper squealed with fright, and turned to
the left to find shelter under some prickly gooseberry bushes. Carlo
yelped with pain when the thorns of the bushes stuck in his nose, and
from that moment Bumper began to like gooseberries.</p>

<p>But the chase was not over. Carlo drove him out of the bushes and chased
him across the lawn into the garden. Bumper tried to hide behind a
cabbage, but Carlo saw his white head, and pounced upon him. He missed
by an inch, and Bumper, now terribly frightened, and panting for breath,
made a dive for a big, dark hole that suddenly opened directly in his
pathway.</p>

<p>He ran in this as fast as he could. Carlo followed a short distance, and
then got stuck. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> black hole grew smaller at the other end, and
Bumper felt that he was safe for the present.</p>

<p>"My, what a narrow escape!" he said, panting for breath. "Now, how am I
ever going to get out again! Carlo will pounce on me if I stick my nose
out. I guess the best thing I can do is to sleep in here, and in the
morning go out when Edith calls me. She'll keep Carlo away."</p>

<p>And with this remark, he rolled up in a ball, and went to sleep.</p>

<h2>STORY VII<br/>BUMPER MEETS THE SEWER RAT</h2>
</div>

<p>Bumper was so young and inexperienced that he didn't know a drain-pipe
from an ordinary hole in the ground, nor for that matter a tree trunk
that was hollow inside from a rabbit's burrow. Bumper was a city-bred
rabbit, born in the backyard of a tenement house, and how could you
expect him to know much of the things that ordinary wild rabbits learn
by heart before their whiskers begin to sprout?</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes the next morning, he stretched himself, and
blinked hard at the circular roof over his head, wondering what sort of
a house he was in now. It took some time for his brain to recall the
events of the previous night. Then he sat up and smiled.</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho!" he laughed. "Carlo must have had a long, cold wait outside for
me. I think I'll take a peek at him."</p>

<p>He was really anxious to see if the little girl was up yet, and if she
had missed him. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> perfect confidence in her, and knew that she
would call off the dog the instant she saw him.</p>

<p>Bumper could see that it was morning, for the bright light shining
through the big end of the drain-pipe proved that. He crawled along
cautiously, making as little noise as possible. If Carlo was waiting at
the entrance to pounce upon him, he wasn't going to be caught napping.</p>

<p>Another thing which drew him toward the mouth of the pipe was the
fragrant odor of good things from the garden. In spite of the big feast
of the night before, Bumper was hungry again, and he longed to get back
in the garden and devour a few more carrots and crisp lettuce leaves.</p>

<p>He was within a few feet of the mouth of the drain-pipe, quite confident
that Carlo had grown tired of watching and left, when a shadow came
between him and the light. Bumper caught sight of a head and forelegs
thrust into the opening, and then, without stopping for further
investigation, he turned tail and ran back. There was a wild scampering
and scraping behind him, and he knew that Carlo was pursuing him in the
hole.</p>

<p>But Carlo couldn't follow him very far. The pipe narrowed so that there
was just room for Bumper to squeeze through, and no dog, certainly not a
big dog like Carlo, could catch him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> in there. When he reached the place
where he had spent the night, he stopped to look around him.</p>

<p>Horror of Horrors! Carlo or some other animal was close behind him,
blocking the entire entrance to the hole. Bumper could hear him scraping
along, and could almost feel his breath. A shiver of terror went clear
through him. In some strange manner the hole had been enlarged over
night, or Carlo had shrunk in size, or what seemed more probable,
another dog much smaller had taken up the pursuit.</p>

<p>With a little yip of fear, Bumper scrambled onward again, making his way
through the drain-pipe as fast as his feet would permit, which, after
all, was not so very fast, for he slipped and lost his footing a dozen
times, and once fell all in a heap where an elbow in the pipe brought
him to an abrupt stop. There were two holes opening before him, one
leading to the right and the other to the left.</p>

<p>Bumper chose the one to the right, and so did the animal pursuing him.
The race continued until the rabbit came to another branch where there
seemed to be three holes leading off into different directions. Bumper
chose the middle One blindly, and ran through it for dear life.</p>

<p>It was very dark, and it was impossible for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> him to tell where he was
going. His one great desire was to escape the pursuing dog or other
animal close behind him. Consequently, he was unprepared for the sudden
climax of his adventure.</p>

<p>The narrow tunnel came to an abrupt ending, and when Bumper shot out of
it he landed in a big, circular space that gave him plenty of
opportunity to turn around and look at his enemy. He had no more idea
what kind of a place he was in now than before. It was all so strange to
him.</p>

<p>"Hello!" a voice called to him out of the small hole.</p>

<p>Bumper looked up, and saw a big Sewer Rat grinning at him from the mouth
of the drain-pipe.</p>

<p>"I never saw a rabbit run faster in all my days," laughed Mr. Sewer Rat.
"I couldn't keep up with you. What did you think was after you?"</p>

<p>Bumper was very angry and indignant now that he realized his flight was
all unnecessary. He disliked Mr. Sewer Rat and all his tribe, for they
had often made their way into the old woman's backyard to annoy the
young bunnies. Besides his bad manners and uncouth ways, the Sewer Rat
was disgustingly dirty in his habits. How could he be otherwise when he
chose to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> in sewers rather than in clean quarters above ground?</p>

<p>"Why were <i>you</i> running so fast?" asked Bumper, not willing to admit the
rat had frightened him.</p>

<p>"Just to frighten you," was the retort. "I wanted to give you the scare
of your life, and I guess I did."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Bumper, assuming an air of dignity. "I wasn't really
frightened so long as I knew you were behind me. Carlo couldn't catch me
until he nabbed you."</p>

<p>"Carlo! Who's Carlo!" demanded the Sewer Rat, pretending ignorance.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ho!" laughed Bumper. "Don't pretend that Carlo, the dog, wasn't
after you. Didn't I see him chase you in the hole? And how frightened
you looked! Why, it nearly made me die with laughter."</p>

<p>Mr. Sewer Rat puffed up his cheeks and gnashed his long, white teeth
angrily. Bumper's fling had hit the mark.</p>

<p>"If Carlo ever touches me," he said, "I'll bite his nose so he'll
remember it. Who's afraid of an old dog like Carlo?"</p>

<p>"You are, I should say," smiled the white rabbit.</p>

<p>The Sewer Rat started to deny this, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> thought better of it.
"Well, I wasn't more frightened than you, Mr. White Rabbit. You're as
pale as a ghost this very minute."</p>

<p>"That's a good one," laughed Bumper. "Pale as a ghost! Why, I'm whiter
than snow all the time. How could I get paler?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sewer Rat gnashed his teeth again, and swished his long tail. He was
plainly angry and discomfitted. So he retorted maliciously:</p>

<p>"You're not white at all. You're so dirty your own mother wouldn't know
you. White! Oh! Ho! Ho! I wish you could see yourself."</p>

<p>Bumper did see himself, or, at least, a part of himself. Both front paws
were muddy; his long ears were covered with iron rust; his fat cheeks
were dusty and cobwebby, and to the ends of his whiskers clung specks of
dirt. In his progress through the drain-pipe he had accumulated
sufficient dirt to change his color from pure white to a rusty gray.</p>

<p>"I can soon clean myself," he remarked, "and the little girl with the
red hair will help me. Is that the hole that leads back to the garden?"</p>

<p>The Sewer Rat suddenly blinked his wicked little eyes. "Yes," he
replied, "if you know the right turns to take. If you don't you'll get
lost, and never find your way out."</p>

<p>"I think I know my way back," said Bumper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> hesitatingly. He hated to
ask favors of the Sewer Rat, but when the latter volunteered information
he was grateful for it.</p>

<p>"You'll find a better way back to the garden by following the abandoned
sewer you're standing in. Keep straight on to the end. It's much better
than crawling back through this small drain-pipe."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" replied Bumper. "I believe I'll go back that way!"</p>

<p>"All right, then. I must be going to my family. I haven't had my
breakfast yet. Good morning!"</p>

<p>Bumper thanked him again, and turned to follow the sewer back to the
garden, not realizing that the Rat had purposely deceived him out of
revenge.</p>

<h2>STORY VIII<br/>BUMPER RUNS INTO A NEST OF BATS</h2>
</div>

<p>The way back to the garden seemed a long one, and Bumper soon began to
entertain doubts about the kindness of Mr. Sewer Rat. It was an old
abandoned sewer, with plenty of room in it for a whole colony of
rabbits, but it was terribly dirty and damp. The musty odor was so
different from the pleasant fragrance of the garden he had recently
left.</p>

<p>"I must have traveled miles and miles," he thought after a while,
stopping to clean off some of the dirt that clung to his white fur.
"Either that Rat didn't know what he was talking about, or he told a
whopping fib. They always were sneaky animals, the Sewer Rats, and I
shouldn't have listened to him."</p>

<p>He stopped to consider whether he shouldn't turn around and retrace his
steps; but he was disturbed by the fear that he could never recognize
the mouth of the drain-pipe he had come through. He had passed a number
of these black holes on his way, all looking alike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should have counted them, and then I'd know which one was mine," he
reflected.</p>

<p>But there was no good crying over spilt milk. He was in the abandoned
sewer, and he had to find his way out somehow. Meanwhile, he was getting
desperately hungry. Oh, for a mouthful of the succulent grass that grew
in the garden, or a cabbage leaf or a piece of celery&mdash;anything, in
fact, that would satisfy that gnawing at the stomach!</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" he sighed. "I must keep going until I find something to eat.
There must be other gardens, and this sewer must lead somewhere."</p>

<p>In a little while he became so thirsty that a drink of water seemed even
more desirable than a bite of food. He tried to lick some of the
moisture from the sides of the sewer, but that was only aggravating. It
seemed to increase rather than diminish his thirst.</p>

<p>One hopeful feature of his adventure was that the big sewer seemed to
grow lighter as he proceeded, and he was sure he was coming near the
end. But before this hope was realized he stumbled upon something that
gave him a shock.</p>

<p>Just ahead of him something long and black hung from the roof of the
sewer, reaching down almost to the bottom. Bumper stopped to gaze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
critically at it, his little heart beating with apprehension. Was this
the shadow of some strange animal, or was it simply an innocent log of
wood that had got wedged in the sewer?</p>

<p>As it didn't move, and was perfectly noiseless, Bumper concluded that it
was harmless, and so he approached it and after sniffing at it began
nibbling the lower part. Suddenly there was a loud squeak, and the big
shadow seemed to part in the middle and fly in every direction. It took
wings so strangely that Bumper was more astounded than frightened.</p>

<p>The sewer was filled with black shadows that flitted all around him.
Then followed a babel of noisy squeaks. Some came so close to his ears
that he dodged and ducked in fear. One pair of sharp beaks caught him on
the tip of his nose and made him squeal, and another nipped the back of
his head. He was too surprised and frightened by this time to run, and
he tried to defend himself with his two front paws.</p>

<p>"It's the Sewer Rat! Bite him! Tweak his nose! Snap his tail! Tear out
his eyes!"</p>

<p>The air was filled with these faint cries before Bumper began to realize
just what he was up against. He had run into a big bunch of bats
sleeping in the abandoned sewer, and his nibbling at them had alarmed
and angered them. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> apparent from their remarks that they mistook
him for Mr. Sewer Rat, who perhaps had annoyed them many times before,
and had even threatened to devour some of them.</p>

<p>"I'm not the Sewer Rat!" cried Bumper. "Please don't snap out my eyes! I
didn't mean to disturb you! Wait! Wait, until I can explain!"</p>

<p>"Who are you? And what are you, then?" cried the biggest and fiercest of
the bats, coming so close that his eyes looked like pin-points of light.</p>

<p>"I'm Bumper, the white rabbit!"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and the flittering wings seemed to stop beating the
air.</p>

<p>"Bumper, the white rabbit! Who ever heard of a white rabbit! All rabbits
are brown or gray."</p>

<p>It was the big bat speaking for the others, but they all joined him in
gnashing their teeth and in whipping the air with their soft, almost
noiseless, wings.</p>

<p>"But I assure you I am a white rabbit," replied Bumper. "Come and look
at me."</p>

<p>This challenge seemed fair, and some of the smaller bats approached
nearer, but the leader warned them back. "Keep away! It's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> Sewer Rat
in disguise. It's a trick of his to catch you."</p>

<p>"Is the Sewer Rat white?" interrupted Bumper.</p>

<p>"No, not unless he's been whitewashed or been sleeping in a barrel of
flour."</p>

<p>Bumper had to smile at this, for he recalled once how a big rat had been
caught in a bag of flour by the old woman who kept rabbits, and his hair
was as white as that of the whitest rabbit.</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Mr. Bat, I haven't been whitewashed, and I haven't
been sleeping in flour. Look at my ears. Does Mr. Sewer Rat have long
ears like mine?"</p>

<p>"No, but he could disguise them by using pieces of white paper. I
wouldn't trust him a minute."</p>

<p>In desperation, Bumper then added: "But look at my tail! Did a Sewer Rat
or any other kind of a Rat have a tail like mine?"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked the big Bat. "I don't see any tail at all. All
rabbits have white tails, and you haven't any at all."</p>

<p>Bumper wagged the stump of tail that he thought would convince the bats,
but for a moment, he wasn't exactly sure that he saw it himself. Instead
of a white, fluffy stub of a tail as soft as cotton, he saw the
dirtiest, blackest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> wad of hair waving in the air that had ever
disgraced a rabbit. The truth flashed upon his mind in an instant. What
he had supposed to be the blindness of the bats was nothing more than a
most natural circumstance.</p>

<p>He was so black with the dust and mud of the drain-pipe that it was
misleading to call himself a white rabbit. He was far from it. He was as
dark as any wild rabbit of the woods&mdash;darker, in fact, for there was no
white fur under his stomach or around his stubby tail.</p>

<p>He was so confused by this discovery that he could not find his tongue
to make reply. The Bats, accepting his silence as proof that his
deception had been found out, suddenly beat their wings and set up a
terrible uproar.</p>

<p>"It's the Sewer Rat in disguise!" shouted the big leader of the Bats.
"Now we'll punish him! Drive him out of the sewer! Peck out his eyes!"</p>

<p>Bumper stopped just long enough to realize that he had no chance in a
fight against all those whirring wings and little gnashing teeth. If he
was to escape at all, he had to get a start on the bats. Even though
flight seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bats, he turned and fled
as fast as his four legs would carry him.</p>

<p>There was plenty of room in the sewer, and Bumper made such tremendous
strides that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> outdistanced all but a few of the leaders. They tried
to land on his back and claw him, but he shook them off, and dodged this
way and that, until the light ahead suddenly became so strong and
blinding that the bats gave up the chase.</p>

<p>When Bumper finally came to the mouth of the sewer, he was all out of
breath, but the view ahead compensated for a lot of his troubles. He
could see the blue sky; green fields and waving trees, and near-by the
rippling surface of a lake or river. It looked like Paradise after the
darkness of the sewer; but all things that glitter, he found out, are
not gold, and every earthly Paradise seems to have its serpent lurking
somewhere around in the grass.</p>

<h2>STORY IX<br/>BUMPER ESCAPES ON A RAFT</h2>
</div>

<p>Bumper took a long time to rest and get back some of his breath before
he ventured to the very mouth of the open sewer. As soon as he was sure
that the bats had abandoned the chase, he threw himself down and closed
his eyes from sheer weariness and exhaustion. Then, with returning
strength and hope, he raised himself on his two hind legs, and looked
around him.</p>

<p>There was water at the mouth of the sewer, and he hopped toward it
eagerly. After lapping enough to satisfy his thirst, he began bathing
himself. He had never been so dirty before in all his life. He was
thankful the red-haired girl wasn't there to see him. She would perhaps
disown him.</p>

<p>This thought soothed his feelings a little, and he splashed around in
the water until most of the dust and dirt was washed off. Then finding a
sunny spot near the entrance, he hopped to it, and sprawled himself out
to dry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he began examining his surroundings very carefully, and a
little anxiously. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> sewer dipped down into the river and disappeared
from view, and on either side of it, and above it, were very steep
walls. No rabbit could climb them. The only other possible way out of
the sewer was by swimming.</p>

<p>Now Bumper had never learned to swim. Perhaps he could do it without
learning, but he felt afraid. None of his family had been swimmers, and
the river was certainly deep. From his place in the sun he could not see
bottom.</p>

<p>Once more the thought of returning to the garden by the way he had come
occurred to him; but memory of the fierce bats and the Sewer Rat
immediately banished all ideas of this kind from his mind. "I'd never go
through that dark sewer again for anything," he said, shuddering. "I
must go on until I find another way back to the little girl."</p>

<p>Bumper's one desire was to return to Edith. He was sorry now that he had
ever jumped out of his pen. If he had been contented and stayed where
the red-haired girl had put him, he would be eating delicious grass and
vegetables now instead of lying there alone, hungry and afraid to go on
or go back.</p>

<p>His hunger came back to him, and gave him a sharp pain in the stomach.
"I must have something to eat," he said. "I'm nearly famished."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was really nothing in sight that he could eat&mdash;not a spear of
grass nor a leaf. Then, just as if to prove to him that manna sometimes
falls from heaven to feed even poor, destitute rabbits, a big leaf came
floating down on the wind and fell almost at his feet. Bumper grabbed
it, and began chewing it greedily.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean, horrid thing!" chirped a voice. "That leaf belonged to
me. It was for my nest, and the wind blew it out of my bill."</p>

<p>Bumper looked up, and saw a small sparrow perched on the top of the
embankment over his head.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was yours, Mrs. Sparrow," Bumper replied. "I thought
the wind just blew it to me."</p>

<p>"Well, you know it now. Please give it to me."</p>

<p>Bumper held the leaf in his mouth, with half of it already chewed up. It
tasted so good that the thought of abandoning it was more than he could
stand.</p>

<p>"If you need it more than I do, Mrs. Sparrow," he said, "I'll give it to
you. But you must prove it."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do. I need it for my nest."</p>

<p>"And I need it to keep me from starving."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sparrow cocked her head sideways and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> looked queerly at him. "You
don't look as if you were starving," she observed. "You're as plump and
sleek as any rabbit I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But I haven't had any breakfast, and I'm not used to it. This
leaf tastes so good I wish I had a hundred more of them."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you go and get them? There are plenty in the park and
woods."</p>

<p>"But how am I going to get them?" asked Bumper. "Don't you see I'm
caught here in the mouth of the sewer. I can't get out without
swimming."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sparrow looked surprised at this information, and flew from her
perch on the embankment to a stone below. She cocked her head sideways,
and looked all around her.</p>

<p>"What puzzles me," she said finally, "is how you ever got in there
without swimming. You can't fly."</p>

<p>Bumper smiled, and shook his head. "No, but I wish I could. I wouldn't
stay here arguing with you about this leaf but fly away and get a good
breakfast of a lot of them."</p>

<p>"Are you really so hungry, Mr. White Rabbit?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am nearly famished."</p>

<p>And then he told Mrs. Sparrow of his adventures in the drain-pipe of the
garden and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> big abandoned sewer. Mrs. Sparrow was evidently affected
by his recital, for she immediately flew away and soon returned with
another green leaf.</p>

<p>"Now eat that, and I'll get you another," she said. "I know what it is
to go without breakfast and dinner. I've had to do it many times. Now
eat your full."</p>

<p>Bumper devoured the leaf so quickly that it seemed as if he must have
swallowed it without chewing it. "You see, Mrs. Sparrow," he remarked,
"you couldn't feed me enough. I have a very big appetite. Why, I could
eat leaves much faster than you could bring them to me."</p>

<p>"So it seems," murmured the sparrow in a little surprised voice. "I
never realized how much some animals can eat at once. I don't think I
can do more than just take the edge of your appetite off."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you. And I shall be grateful to you! If you'll
bring me just a few more leaves, I will then ask you to direct me back
to the little girl's garden."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'd like to, but there are so many gardens around, and they
all look alike."</p>

<p>"But there's only one with a red-haired girl in it," replied Bumper.
"Can't you fly away, and find her?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll try," said Mrs. Sparrow.</p>

<p>So after feeding Bumper a few more green leaves, she flew away to find
the garden. She was gone so long that Bumper got very restless and
discouraged. The few leaves hadn't satisfied his hunger; they had merely
stimulated his desire for more. It was past noon when Mrs. Sparrow
finally reappeared at the entrance to the sewer.</p>

<p>"What news?" asked Bumper, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Nothing that's good, Mr. White Rabbit. I flew into garden after
garden&mdash;and all of them pretty, and full of fruits and vegetables&mdash;but
there was no red-headed girl in any of them. I saw dogs, too&mdash;many of
them&mdash;but I couldn't tell whether any of them answered to the name of
Carlo."</p>

<p>"Then it looks to me," remarked Bumper, "that I'm in for a long swim.
Where does this river go to?"</p>

<p>"Way out into the country through beautiful fields and woods," replied
Mrs. Sparrow.</p>

<p>"Could I reach them, I wonder! I might drown before I could get ashore."</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Mrs. Sparrow. "Why not escape on a raft? Here comes a
big board down the river. You could hop on it, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> even get wet.
Yes, you could do it. It's floating close to the shore."</p>

<p>"Where is it?" exclaimed Bumper, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Right here! Now get ready for a long jump."</p>

<p>Bumper was not only ready, but very anxious, and when the floating board
appeared a yard or more from the mouth of the sewer he crouched for a
spring. It was a long jump, and Bumper had some doubts about making it;
but he put all his strength in it, and hopped high in the air, and
landed safely on the raft.</p>

<p>"Hi! How was that for a jump!" he exclaimed, when he stood upright on
the board.</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Mrs. Sparrow. "I wish you a good voyage! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Bumper wagged his ears in reply, and shouted back a hearty farewell.
Then he turned to look down the river. He had escaped from the sewer,
but evidently he had adventures still ahead, for the river was broad and
long, and very swift in places.</p>

<h2>STORY X<br/>BUMPER SEES HIS FIRST BLACK CROW</h2>
</div>

<p>When Bumper floated away from the mouth of the sewer on his raft, he
felt quite jubilant, and a little proud of his achievement. He had
escaped the bats successfully, and now he had found a way out of the
sewer itself. He was so puffed up by these exploits that he wasn't a bit
afraid of what might happen to him on the river.</p>

<p>"This is really much better than being cooped up in the old woman's
backyard," he reflected. "Not even Jimsy or Wheedles ever dreamed of
such adventures as I've had. My! I feel like a great traveler already."</p>

<p>But when the current of the river began to draw his raft away from the
shore into the middle, his enthusiasm was not quite so great. The stream
grew rougher, and little white caps appeared ahead. His raft began to
bob up and down, and pretty soon a wave washed over it and wet Bumper's
feet.</p>

<p>This made him very uncomfortable, for a rabbit doesn't like wet feet any
more than a cat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> does. He tried to sit up on his hind legs and dry his
front paws, but other waves washed over the raft and wet his haunches.
He couldn't very well stand on his front paws, and dry his hind ones, so
he had to endure the wet and cold.</p>

<p>The river passed through a beautiful field all aglow with flowers and
green grass, but the shore was too far away for Bumper to swim to it.
"I'll leave well enough alone," he said, "and stick to my raft."</p>

<p>Then he came to a woods through which the river flowed. It was swampy
here, and twigs and tree trunks seemed to grow out of the water long
distances from the shore.</p>

<p>"If I can find a tree fallen in the river, I'll hop on it and escape,"
Bumper reasoned.</p>

<p>He was so absorbed in watching for a chance to escape that he hardly
noticed a black shadow hovering over him. Not until it approached very
close did he duck his head and look up.</p>

<p>"Caw! Caw!"</p>

<p>It was a big, black crow. Now Bumper had never seen a crow. In fact, he
had never seen any of the wild animals of the woods, for it must be
remembered that he was born in the city. Of course, he had seen plenty
of sparrows, for they live in the cities, and also sewer rats. A few
bats had also flown over the old woman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> backyard on warm nights
hunting insects, and Bumper was more or less acquainted with them.</p>

<p>But a crow! He didn't know what it was. So when the loud, raucous cry
assailed his ears, he squatted down on his raft, expecting every minute
to be attacked by the black shadow above.</p>

<p>"Caw! Caw!" screamed the big bird.</p>

<p>"Mr. Caw! Mr. Caw!" cried Bumper, supposing that was the bird's name.
"Good morning! How do you do?"</p>

<p>Now, the crow is very sensitive about his inability to sing. He used to
think that cawing was singing until the birds all laughed at him. After
that he kept by himself, and very rarely joined the other birds in the
woods or fields.</p>

<p>Bumper's calling him by that name very naturally angered him. It was a
slight, a slur upon his voice, and he resented it at once. It must be
remembered also that the crow had never seen a white rabbit before, and
Bumper's appearance floating on the plank had excited the bird's
curiosity. White rabbits don't run wild in the woods, and Bumper was
almost as much a mystery to the crow as the latter was to the former.
All the rabbits Mr. Crow knew were gray or brown, with a white belly and
tail, and none of them had pink eyes. So it was quite natural that the
black bird should be curious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> surprised at the sight of a pure white
rabbit, with pink eyes, floating down the river on a raft.</p>

<p>"Caw! Caw!" screamed the crow, flapping his wings so that the wind made
by them ruffled Bumper's hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Mr. Caw. I understand," replied Bumper, getting excited by
the nearness of this big, black thing.</p>

<p>"How dare you make fun of me!" cried Mr. Crow, striking the tip of
Bumper's ears with his wings. "I'll teach you to laugh at my voice."</p>

<p>With that he struck out with both wings, and nearly upset Bumper from
his raft. Frightened by this exhibition of anger, Bumper's teeth
chattered, and his voice shook.</p>

<p>"I wasn't making fun of your voice, Mr. Caw," he said. "I think it's a
very sweet and pleasant voice. Please don't upset my raft."</p>

<p>The crow, a little mollified by this flattery, circled around the raft,
and surveyed the scene below with eyes filled with curiosity.</p>

<p>"What are you, anyway?" he called down at last. "You look like Mr.
Rabbit, but I never saw one so white before. What's your name? And what
are you doing on that raft?"</p>

<p>"I'm Bumper, the White Rabbit, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rabbits are never white," interrupted the crow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I assure you I am."</p>

<p>"Then you're not a rabbit. You're something else."</p>

<p>Bumper smiled and tried to look pleased. "Would you be something else if
you were white?" he asked.</p>

<p>Now this reference to an old fable of the crows touched a sensitive
spot. There were white crows, or at least there were rumors of them, and
every crow liked to believe the story was true. If one white crow, then
why not more? Why shouldn't all crows be white?</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a white crow?" the bird asked.</p>

<p>"Crow! Crow!" stammered Bumper. "Is that your name? I'm sorry, Mr. Crow,
I made a mistake. You see, I'm from the city, and crows don't live
there."</p>

<p>"No, I should say not&mdash;unless the white ones do." He came nearer and
showed excitement. "Answer me. Did you ever see a white crow? If all
rabbits from the city are white, then maybe that's where the white crows
come from."</p>

<p>Now Bumper was learning shrewdness, and he saw right away through the
vanity of the bird that had him at his mercy. So, instead of answering
directly, he pretended that he knew a great deal more than he did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm surprised, Mr. Crow," he said, "that you've never been in the city
to see for yourself. You really mean to tell me you've never been in the
city?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, it's not a place for crows."</p>

<p>"Maybe not for black ones, but white crows are perfectly safe there, the
same as white rabbits. I never saw one hurt there."</p>

<p>"Don't men shoot them?"</p>

<p>"No. People don't shoot birds and animals in the city. They're not
allowed to carry guns at all. You're really safer than out here in the
country."</p>

<p>"But there's nothing to eat in the city&mdash;not for crows. Is there?"</p>

<p>"All the white crows I knew were well fed. And the sparrows get plenty.
People feed them sometimes in the park. Why, there are squirrels that
have all the nuts they can eat, and they don't have to hunt for them."</p>

<p>"White squirrels?" interrupted Mr. Crow, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a white squirrel, Mr. Crow?" asked Bumper, instead of
answering this question.</p>

<p>"No, I never did."</p>

<p>"Then," sighing, "I'm afraid there are none."</p>

<p>Mr. Crow wasn't so much interested in white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> squirrels as in white
crows, and he dismissed the matter from his mind. After a pause, he
added: "I believe I'll take a trip to the city, if there's no danger.
I'd like to visit some of the white crows. It may be if I stay with them
in the city, I'll turn white, too."</p>

<p>Bumper didn't want to deceive him, but he was still afraid of him.
Instead of answering directly, he asked: "Before you go, Mr. Crow, can't
you help me to get ashore? I'm very tired of this raft. You make so much
wind with your beautiful wings, I'm sure you could blow me inshore with
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I could," was the reply. "Well, since you were kind
enough to tell me about my relatives in the city, I'll help you."</p>

<p>He began beating his wings violently, and the wind from them nearly blew
Bumper off the raft, but the board floated closer and closer to the
shore until the rabbit with a hop landed on it, and bade the crow
good-bye.</p>

<h2>STORY XI<br/>BUMPER MEETS A FOX</h2>
</div>

<p>When the White Rabbit hopped ashore from his raft, he was so happy that
he gave the board a kick with his two hind legs, and sent it spinning
far out into the stream. He supposed that he was all alone, and no one
had seen him land, but he was surprised when a voice near him cried out:</p>

<p>"Look out! What are you trying to do?"</p>

<p>There was a flop in the water, and when Bumper turned he saw a queer
looking fish swimming toward the shore, using his hind legs instead of
fins to propel him along. He had big, staring eyes, and a green head,
with white under his throat.</p>

<p>"That's what I call a mean trick!" the swimmer added, hopping upon a
lily-pad, for it was Mr. Bull-Frog that Bumper had mistaken for a queer
fish. "You upset me from that leaf and disturbed my sleep. If I hadn't
been an excellent swimmer I should have been dead by this time."</p>

<p>"What did I do?" asked Bumper, in surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you do?" was the indignant retort. "What but push that board
against my lily-pad and knock me in the water! I call that doing a good
deal."</p>

<p>Bumper was inclined to laugh at the angry Bull-Frog, who was swelling up
to twice his usual size and puffing out his cheeks; but he refrained
from this when he realized that he had unintentionally disturbed the
frog's noonday siesta. So he answered in a friendly way, hoping to
pacify his feelings.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Frog, but I didn't see you on the lily-pad. The fact is,
your head is exactly the color of the lily-pad, and no one could
distinguish it a few feet away. What a lovely green it is, too&mdash;your
head, I mean."</p>

<p>Mr. Bull-Frog was apparently as susceptible to flattery as Mr. Crow, and
his ruffled feelings began to subside. "Yes, I fancy it is a pretty
green," he said. "I've always heard that the lily was the prettiest of
flowers, and that's why my family is attracted by it. Would you like to
sun yourself on one of these pads? They're very soft and cool."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," laughed Bumper, "I'm afraid I'd get my feet wet.
Besides, I'm desperately hungry. If you don't mind I'll eat some of
these delicious leaves and grasses."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go ahead. I don't mind. But I can't see what you like about them to
eat."</p>

<p>"Neither can I see why a frog likes flies and insects. Ugh! The thought
of eating them makes me sick."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Mr. Frog, "I suppose every one to his taste. As for me,
I prefer flies and worms, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and looked through the low brush into the woods
back of the river front. Bumper was so busy filling his little stomach
with green, succulent things that he scarcely noticed the other's
hesitation.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and," continued Mr. Frog, after a pause, "some animals prefer eating
rats, lizards, toads, and rabbits."</p>

<p>"Rabbits!" exclaimed Bumper. "Who eats rabbits?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Fox for one," answered the Frog, "and if my eyes don't deceive me
there's one in the bushes waiting to eat you. If you'll excuse me, I'll
take a dive. I've known Mr. Fox to eat frogs when he was very hungry."</p>

<p>There was a flop in the water, and the bullfrog disappeared from sight.
Bumper reared up on his hind legs and looked around him. He had never
seen a fox, but his mother had often told him tales about their cruelty.
They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> forever hunting little rabbits to eat, and they were as sly
and cunning as they were barbarous.</p>

<p>Bumper's quick eyes caught sight of Mr. Fox hiding in the bushes, and,
for a moment, his heart beat a loud tattoo. What was he to do? Jump back
in the river and try to swim across to the opposite shore, or face the
fox and try to escape from him by running?</p>

<p>The woods were very thick all along the river's bank, and there were
many good hiding-places; but Mr. Fox stood ready to head him off either
way he ran. Bumper was in a quandary just what to do.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Fox!" he called, hoping to gain time by being polite
and friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox sniffed the air, raising his nose several inches above his head.
He seemed quite uncertain about something, but his nose apparently
satisfied him.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he answered finally, grinning. "But what a joke you
played on me, Mr. Rabbit. I couldn't believe my own eyes. What's
happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing," stammered Bumper, mystified. "Why do you ask such a
question."</p>

<p>"Why? Because you're all white. I thought first you were a ghost. And
your eyes&mdash;they're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> pink. Whoever heard of a white rabbit with pink
eyes?"</p>

<p>Bumper was quick to see the cause of the fox's surprise. Like the crow,
he had never seen a white rabbit before, and he suddenly gained
confidence by this knowledge.</p>

<p>"How do you know I'm not a ghost?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"How do I know? Ha! Ha! That's a good one! But I'll tell you how I know.
I smell you. No ghost could have that delicious rabbit smell that fills
my nose every time the wind blows toward me."</p>

<p>Bumper, for the lack of any words to say, laughed long and hard at this
remark. Then he controlled himself, and added: "I wouldn't trust my
nose, Mr. Fox. A rabbit's ghost might smell just as sweet and delicious
as a real one."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," grinned Mr. Fox. "Anyway, I'm going to find out.
If you're a ghost, why, it will be easy enough for you to disappear."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but I should hate to disappoint you. Now, do you know
where rabbits go when they die?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in my stomach."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox laughed long and loud at this cruel joke, and Bumper winced; but
he was playing for time to think of a plan to escape. Evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> Mr. Fox
was not to be outwitted by flattery, and he determined upon another
ruse.</p>

<p>There was a fallen tree near him, but to reach it he would have to
advance a few feet straight toward the fox. The heart of the tree was
rotten and hollow, and to escape in this was Bumper's design. But how to
distract Mr. Fox's attention until he could reach it was the question.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fox," he said suddenly, "I met Mr. Crow on the river, and he
asked me about the white crows in the city. When I told him, he flew
away to the city to see if living there would turn him white. That's a
joke on Mr. Crow all right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but are there white crows in the city?"</p>

<p>"There are white rabbits. Then why not white crows, and white foxes?"</p>

<p>"White foxes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why not? Didn't you ever see one?"</p>

<p>"No, but I've heard of them, it seems to me, but they live way up north,
don't they?"</p>

<p>"If you want to see one now," continued Bumper, "look at the sun for ten
seconds, and sneeze twice, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you, and then I'll tell you the rest."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox, after all, was a little vain, or at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> very curious, and
this strange proposition interested him. He raised his head, and looked
straight into the blinding sun.</p>

<p>"Now count&mdash;one, two, three, four, and sneeze," added Bumper.</p>

<p>No fox can look hard at the sun long without sneezing, and after
counting six this one nearly sneezed his head off. That was what Bumper
was waiting for. He made a dive for the hollow tree, and got inside of
it. When Mr. Fox reached the log, and found the hole too small for him,
he was quite mad, and said: "I'll make you pay for that trick some day,
Mr. Rabbit."</p>

<h2>STORY XII<br/>BUMPER ADMIRED BY THE BIRDS</h2>
</div>

<p>It isn't good for us to be too smart. It sometimes makes us vain, and
then one day we overdo it. Bumper had some excuse for playing the trick
on Mr. Crow and Mr. Fox, for his life depended upon it; but his success
was giving him a little swelled head. He began to feel that he could get
out of any danger by using his wits.</p>

<p>"It takes a city rabbit to find a way out of difficulty," he reflected,
as he lay snugly in the hollow trunk of the tree. "These country animals
are dull-witted. I do hope my cousins of the woods are not so stupid.
Perhaps they are, and that's why people say rabbits are cunning but very
stupid."</p>

<p>This sort of reasoning was the very thing that got him in trouble, and
nearly caused his death. He was so sure that he had outwitted Mr. Fox,
he decided after a while to leave the hollow trunk, and eat some of the
green leaves and branches growing around outside.</p>

<p>But he knew less about the cunning and patience of the fox than he
thought. Instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> trotting off in the woods, chagrined and disgusted
by his defeat, the fox was lying low ready to pounce on the white rabbit
the moment he showed himself. He was so still that Bumper couldn't hear
the rustle of a leaf or the snap of a twig.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go out now," Bumper said finally. "I'm dreadfully hungry."</p>

<p>Instead of poking his head out cautiously to investigate, he walked
straight from the hollow trunk into the very jaws of the fox. There was
a sharp click of teeth, and Bumper felt a terrible pain in one of his
long ears. He must have leaped five feet in the air, and another five
feet sideways. The fox had missed his neck by an inch, but to make up
for this mistake, he now pursued the rabbit, leaping nearly as high in
the air to catch him as Bumper.</p>

<p>Terrified by the attack, and not knowing what to do, the white rabbit
jumped this way and that, clearing high bushes and landing in dense
thickets that tore his fur and hurt him terribly. But the fox followed
him, paying no attention to the briers and thorns.</p>

<p>It was a narrow escape. For a moment Bumper thought his time had come.
He couldn't get back to the hollow tree trunk, and there was no other
hiding-place near that the fox couldn't follow him in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>It certainly would have gone hard with him, and the rest of his
adventures could never have been told, if a couple of blue jays hadn't
built a nest in a tree directly over him. The commotion in the bushes
startled the birds, and with loud, shrill cries they darted down to see
what was doing. The sight of the fox angered them. Foxes robbed birds'
nests whenever they got a chance, and the blue jays knew this.
Therefore, a fox in the neighborhood of their home was not to be
tolerated.</p>

<p>They flew down like two blue streaks and landed their sharp bills on the
head and face of Mr. Fox. One stroke came so near to one of his eyes
that he dodged and ducked, and stopped pursuing Bumper long enough to
snap at the birds.</p>

<p>But the blue jays were prepared for this, and they kept well beyond his
reach. As soon as he turned from them to the rabbit again they flew back
to the attack. They punished him unmercifully, pecking at him until he
was so angry that he could hardly see straight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, Bumper was taking advantage of this interruption.
He was running through the underbrush as fast as he could until he was
far ahead. Right and left he searched for a hole or any kind of an
opening he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> crawl in. And there, just ahead of him, appeared what
he was looking for! This time it was the hollow branch of a giant tree
hanging down, with one end still attached to the trunk.</p>

<p>Bumper was in the hollow branch like a flash. Mr. Fox reached it just a
moment too late, and to vent his anger at losing the rabbit the second
time he clawed and snapped at the branch as if he would rip it asunder.
But the limb, with a decayed heart, had a stout shell, and the fox soon
gave it up in disgust.</p>

<p>Now, the hollow branch, as you know, had one end on the ground, and the
other still attached to the trunk where the wind had broken it off. So
Bumper found his hole slanting upward, and as he crawled through to the
other end he was actually climbing a tree. Perhaps you have heard that
rabbits can't climb trees, but Bumper did in this instance.</p>

<p>When he reached the upper end, he found himself ten feet from the
ground, with Mr. Fox below and unable to reach him. It was such an
unusual sight to see a rabbit up a tree that the fox was more puzzled
than ever. "Could white rabbits climb trees?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>Between his discouragement at being twice outwitted, and his amazement
at finding a white rabbit with pink eyes that could climb a tree, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Fox finally dropped his tail between his legs and trotted away. Bumper
watched him go, and sighed with relief. The blue jays were equally
relieved in mind, and once more returned to their home to guard it
against invasion.</p>

<p>When Bumper stuck his head out of the upper end of the big tree branch,
he noticed that he was up among the birds which had been singing a
lively concert until he interrupted them. There were birds which Bumper
had never seen before, some with startling plumage, and others with
voices that sounded like flutes.</p>

<p>They did not renew their singing, but perked their heads sideways and
watched this strange thing popping out of the hollow limb. Finally one
of them, Mrs. Oriole, clad in a suit of gold, streaked with black and
gray, spoke.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Rabbit's ghost, I do believe. Mr. Fox must have caught him
after all."</p>

<p>"If it's a ghost, I'd like to have some of his white fur for my nest,"
remarked Rusty the Blackbird. "I think I'll steal some."</p>

<p>"He's a pretty lively ghost," warned Piney the Purple Finch. "I wouldn't
venture too near."</p>

<p>Bumper blinked his pink eyes at them, and smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm not a ghost yet," he said. "I'm quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> alive and well, but very
hungry. If you don't mind I'll eat a few of these delicious green
leaves."</p>

<p>The birds watched him in silence. They were as curious and puzzled as
the Crow had been. Finally, Mr. Pine Grosbeak plucked up courage to
approach nearer.</p>

<p>"If you're really alive," he said, "let me pluck some of those beautiful
white hairs as souvenirs. I never saw such lovely fur before."</p>

<p>"You can have one hair," laughed Bumper, "just to prove to you that I'm
a real live rabbit."</p>

<p>Mr. Pine Grosbeak took him at his word, and plucked a hair from his
back. It made Bumper wince.</p>

<p>"Surely you'll give me one, too, for my nest," added Piney the Purple
Finch, and without waiting for consent he plucked two. Rusty the
Blackbird came swooping down next. "I need some of your beautiful white
fur to show my little ones," he said. "I'll take three."</p>

<p>The other birds expressed their admiration, and then begged a few hairs,
too. There was Mrs. Crested Flycatcher, and Mrs. Ph[oe]be Bird, and
little Towhee the Chewink. The process of extracting a few hairs from
his back caused Bumper exquisite pain, but he wanted to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> obliging,
especially as the birds all admired and flattered him.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Woodpecker, who had been rapping on the dead trees of the
woods, appeared, Bumper decided it was time for him to call a halt.
"That's all I can spare," he said, and darted back into the hollow
branch.</p>

<p>He was glad to make friends with the birds, but he didn't want to be
robbed of all the clothes he had.</p>

<h2>STORY XIII<br/>BUMPER NEEDS A DOCTOR</h2>
</div>

<p>It was necessary for Bumper to show a certain amount of firmness with
his newly-made friends, and when he finally emerged from the hollow
branch again he made a little speech to the birds.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, dear friends," he said, "I must ask you to stop
plucking me any more. I really can't afford to lose my fur. It's all the
protection I have from the rain, and when winter comes I'll need it to
keep me warm."</p>

<p>"But a few hairs to line my nest with won't hurt you," pleaded Mrs.
Ph[oe]be Bird.</p>

<p>"No," replied Bumper firmly, "if I let you have some I must do the same
to all the others, and I don't want to offend Towhee the Chewink or Mr.
Crested Flycatcher or any of the others. I want to be friends with all
of you."</p>

<p>The justice of this was recognized by all the birds, and they decided
not to press the question; but they were voluble with their expressions
of admiration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never saw such beautiful pink eyes before," remarked Piney the Purple
Finch.</p>

<p>"Nor such snow-white fur," added Mr. Pine Grosbeak.</p>

<p>"I never knew there was such a thing as a white rabbit in the world,"
said Rusty the Blackbird.</p>

<p>Bumper could not feel other than puffed up by such remarks, but he tried
to hide it from his new friends.</p>

<p>"Are all the rabbits in the woods brown or gray, then?" he asked. "I
should like to see them. Do they live around here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Purple Finch, "but they're very much frightened and
keep to their burrows since Mr. Fox came here to live."</p>

<p>"I should like to find them," sighed Bumper. "The fact is, I'm lonesome,
and a little bit homesick. I'm not used to the woods, and I should
dearly like to find some of my brown cousins so they could teach me
things."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you needed much teaching," laughed the Red-Headed
Woodpecker, tapping the limb with his powerful bill. "Any rabbit that
can escape from Mr. Fox and climb a tree as you did must know a great
deal."</p>

<p>The other birds nodded their heads at this remark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> and Bumper looked
pleased at the compliment to his shrewdness.</p>

<p>"Still," he said, "I'd like to meet my country cousins."</p>

<p>"If I see any of them," Rusty the Blackbird replied, "I'll tell them
about you. They'll be surprised to know of your coming."</p>

<p>The rest agreed to carry the news to the wild rabbits when they saw
them, and Bumper knew that he would soon find his country cousins. He
felt that he would be welcome, and safer with them. There were so many
puzzling things about the woods that, in spite of his self-confidence,
he was often embarrassed.</p>

<p>This conclusion was further impressed upon him very forcibly a few hours
later. When he was certain that the fox had left the vicinity for good,
he crawled through his tunnel to the ground, and began feeding on the
wild grasses, leaves and strange plants that grew so thickly in the
woods.</p>

<p>Most of the plants were new to him. He hardly recognized any of them.
Some were sweet and juicy, and others were so bitter that one taste was
enough. No one could help him in the selection of his food, and he had
to trust to his instinct.</p>

<p>But instinct isn't always a safe guide when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> one is not familiar with
his surroundings. Now just what plant it was that disagreed with him
Bumper never knew. His little stomach was so full of leaves and plants
that when he first began to feel sick and giddy he thought it was due to
overeating.</p>

<p>"I'll just lie down in the shade now and rest," he said. "Then when I
feel better I'll hop around and find a place to spend the night."</p>

<p>This was a wise decision, but it wasn't a cure. Something he had eaten
clearly disagreed with him. Instead of growing better he felt worse the
longer he rested. In time he was feeling so sick and giddy that if Mr.
Fox had appeared he would have made short work of Bumper. His groans
soon attracted the birds, and they flew to where he was lying and asked
him the trouble.</p>

<p>"I'm dying, I think," moaned Bumper. "I must have eaten some poisonous
plant, and I know I'm dying."</p>

<p>The birds were startled by this information, and they held an immediate
consultation.</p>

<p>"It's perhaps true what he says," remarked Mrs. Ph[oe]be Bird. "He's
eaten some poisonous plant."</p>

<p>"If we only knew what it was," added the Pine Grosbeak, "we might help
him. There's an antidote for every poison."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," assented the Purple Finch, "but not knowing the kind of poison,
we can't prescribe the antidote."</p>

<p>"Why not," suggested the Crested Flycatcher, "give him all the
antidotes, and then we're sure to give him the right one."</p>

<p>Rusty the Blackbird laughed out loud at this suggestion. "Why," he said,
"we'd stuff him so full of antidotes that he'd die anyhow. No, I think
we'd better see Mr. Crane."</p>

<p>"What could he do? He's no kind of a doctor," indignantly remarked Mrs.
Ph[oe]be Bird. "The idea of calling him in!"</p>

<p>Rusty, who was a jolly, rollicking bird, winked, and added: "No, he
isn't much of a doctor, it's true, but he's got one medicine that nearly
always works. I'll go fetch him."</p>

<p>During the dispute that followed, Rusty slipped away, and before the
argument had reached a climax, he returned, accompanied by Mr. Crane.</p>

<p>"Now, Dr. Crane," said Rusty, smiling and winking, "see what you can do
with the White Rabbit. I told you what ailed him. He's eaten too much of
something that disagrees with him."</p>

<p>"Then I can cure him," gravely replied Dr. Crane, approaching Bumper's
side. The other birds crowded around to see what he would do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> The
appearance of Mr. Crane in the r&ocirc;le of a doctor was a new one to them,
and they were curious to see how well he would acquit himself.</p>

<p>"Let me see your tongue," Mr. Crane said solemnly.</p>

<p>Bumper stuck out his tongue obediently, for he felt so sick that he
didn't care what happened to him.</p>

<p>"That's good! Now I must look down your throat. Open it wide."</p>

<p>Bumper readily complied, and Mr. Crane looked down it.</p>

<p>"Now hold it open," Mr. Crane continued. "Don't close it until I tell
you. I won't hurt you."</p>

<p>Then to the surprise of Bumper and all the birds, he inserted his long,
slender bill down the throat as if he intended to pull something out of
it. But he had no such intention. He simply twisted the bill around
gently.</p>

<p>Bumper felt a tickling sensation in his throat, and he wanted to gag,
but the bill prevented him. The tickling went on for some time until
Bumper, in spite of himself, began to gag and retch. Then, as suddenly
as Dr. Crane had inserted his bill in the throat, he withdrew it.</p>

<p>But Dr. Crane had accomplished his purpose. The tickling in the throat
had started Bumper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> to vomiting, and all his dinner, including the
poisonous plant, came up with a rush. It made him weak and faint, but
the pain in his stomach was relieved, and when he was through he looked
up and said faintly: "Thank you, Dr. Crane, I feel much better."</p>

<p>And Rusty the Blackbird, flapping his wings, crowed with delight: "What
did I tell you! Dr. Crane carries an antidote for every poison in his
bill! But it's a bitter medicine sometimes."</p>

<h2>STORY XIV<br/>BUMPER MEETS MR. BEAR</h2>
</div>

<p>Bumper spent a quiet, restful night after Dr. Crane had removed the
trouble that was causing his sickness; but he was very weak and faint,
and he slept long after the birds were up and singing. He was a little
afraid at first to eat anything when he finally crawled from his hole in
the decayed tree branch; but, recognizing some sweet birch trees, he ate
moderately of the leaves and bark.</p>

<p>This seemed to put new life in him, and by early noon he felt quite
himself again. Rusty the Blackbird, who had taken quite an interest in
him, brought him the cheering news that his country cousins were living
in a burrow a few miles back in the thick woods.</p>

<p>"Take this deer trail back about a mile, and you'll find them," he said.
"You can't miss their home. It's under a big rock which you'll come to."</p>

<p>Bumper thanked him, and decided to begin his journey at once. He was
very anxious to find a home with the wild rabbits, for his chance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
getting back to the garden where the red-headed girl lived was very
slim. He had no idea how far down the river he had floated, nor what
direction to take to find the garden.</p>

<p>"Is there any danger of meeting Mr. Fox on the trail?" he asked a little
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No," replied Rusty, "for Buster the Bear frequents the trail, and Mr.
Fox is dreadfully afraid of him."</p>

<p>"But how about Buster the Bear eating me up?"</p>

<p>"He might," admitted Rusty, "if he caught you, and was very hungry, but
you don't want to let him catch you."</p>

<p>"That's true," replied Bumper, "but I might not be able to avoid him. Is
he as quick as Mr. Fox?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! You can easily outrun him. He's so clumsy he falls over
his own big feet sometimes, and he makes such a noise you can hear him
coming a mile away."</p>

<p>"Then I don't believe I'm afraid of him," replied Bumper, in a voice of
relief.</p>

<p>When he started out on his travels he felt pretty good, and on the way
he stopped to eat every time he found something he knew was good for
him. He avoided all strange plants, and ate only those he recognized.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time he came to such thick woods that if it hadn't been for
the deer trail he would have been lost, but he followed Rusty's
directions, and kept strictly to the well-worn path. When he grew tired,
he rested by the wayside, always hiding in the thick bushes, and keeping
one eye and both ears open. There were many strange and wonderful noises
in the woods, and more than once Bumper started up with fright.</p>

<p>But nothing happened to him until he was so far in the woods that he
thought the big rock must be near. He kept a sharp lookout for it. Just
then he heard a noise so different from anything that had startled him
before that he stopped to listen. It seemed as if some one was in great
pain, and needed help.</p>

<p>Now Bumper was very tender-hearted, and any one in distress made him
very sad. So instead of keeping on the trail, he wandered off to find
out who was moaning so loudly.</p>

<p>And what he beheld was enough to make any rabbit laugh! It was Buster
the Bear fast asleep, snoring as if he enjoyed it. Bumper was frightened
at first by the sight of the big, shaggy head and body, but when he
recalled Rusty's words, and saw that Buster was sleeping, he stopped and
laughed. It was a sight to make any one laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Buster's big, shaggy body rose and fell with every breath, and each time
a loud snore came from his half open mouth. It sounded like a wheezy
pair of bellows trying to play a tune. Bumper had never heard anything
like it in his life.</p>

<p>While he stood off at a safe distance watching, a bumblebee lighted on
Buster's nose and tickled it. The bear brushed it off with a paw, and
rolled over to renew his sleep. But, unfortunately for Buster, he
whacked the bee so hard that he must have hurt it.</p>

<p>Anyway, the bumblebee resented it, and gave him a sharp sting on the
nose. The effect was startling. Buster came to life with a jump, and let
out a loud:</p>

<p>"B-r-r-r! Whoof!"</p>

<p>The ground seemed to tremble as he struggled to his feet, and swung his
huge paws at the bee. But the bumblebee, having accomplished its
purpose, calmly flew away. Buster rubbed his smarting nose, and growled
angrily.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught sight of Bumper grinning at him. He stopped rubbing
his nose to stare and blink at the white rabbit. Bumper, now that he was
discovered, ceased grinning, and began to feel afraid.</p>

<p>"You think it very funny, don't you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> growled Buster, his little eyes
flashing. "I wish he'd stung you instead of me. Drat the old bumblebees!
I wonder what they're made for!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I couldn't tell you," replied Bumper, in an unsteady voice.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose you're made for?" continued Buster, eyeing him
queerly.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;to&mdash;make little boys and girls happy, I suppose," Bumper
stammered.</p>

<p>Buster grinned at this stammering remark. Then, with a leer, he added:
"No, that isn't the reason. It's something else. Want me to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I'd like to know."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it's to give Mr. Fox right back of you a good meal."</p>

<p>Bumper gave a jump of nearly three feet when he heard this. He didn't
suppose the fox was anywhere near, and the thought that he was right
behind, ready to spring upon him, sent the blood racing through his
body. But when he turned, expecting to see dripping jaws about to close
upon his neck, he was surprised and then puzzled. There was no fox in
sight. However, he wasn't to be deceived, if Mr. Fox was hiding, and he
stood ready to spring away, his body quivering with fright, and his pink
eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed Buster the Bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> in a deep rumble, rolling over on
his fat sides. "Ho! Ho! Ho! What a scare I gave you! Now we're quits.
The joke's on you!"</p>

<p>It took Bumper some time to realize that it was only a joke, and not a
near tragedy for him. Finally he turned a shamed, embarrassed face
toward Buster, and grinned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"The next time I see any one in trouble," he said, "I won't laugh at
him, Mr. Bear. You've taught me a good lesson."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I call taking a joke in the proper spirit," smiled
Buster. "I'm sorry I gave you such a shock."</p>

<p>"And I'm sorry I laughed when the bee stung your nose."</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that, I didn't mind the sting so much as the interruption of
my sleep." Buster rubbed his nose as he spoke. Then he added, addressing
the white rabbit:</p>

<p>"Where are you bound? You must be lost. I never saw a white rabbit out
of the city before."</p>

<p>"Were you ever in the city?" asked Bumper, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Sure! I was in the Zoo for a whole year until I escaped."</p>

<p>"Then you know something how I feel. The country's very strange to me,
and I feel a bit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> lonesome. Could you tell me where my country cousins
live&mdash;the wild rabbits?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Buster, "but I'm not sure they'll welcome your coming.
However, you can find them by following that trail a little further
until you come to a big rock. They live under it where Mr. Fox can't get
them."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Bumper. "I think I'll be going, then. I must find
them before night."</p>

<h2>STORY XV<br/>BUMPER FINDS HIS COUNTRY COUSINS</h2>
</div>

<p>After leaving Buster the Bear, Bumper did not have far to go before he
stumbled upon the rock under which the wild rabbits had their burrow. It
was a big, towering rock right in the middle of the woods, with trees
trying to grow on top of it, and under it, as if they were determined to
lift it and roll it away.</p>

<p>When the white rabbit first saw it his heart beat high with expectation.
This was to be the end of his journey. When he found it impossible to
get back to the garden where the red-headed girl lived, he concluded the
best he could do was to join the wild rabbits and live with them. They
would teach him the ways of the woods, and perhaps, in time he would be
happy and content as a member of their family.</p>

<p>In spite of the dangers and ventures that had marked his progress, he
was greatly pleased with the woods, and the freedom he enjoyed appealed
to him. But to make his happiness complete he needed companions and
friends of his own kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The friendship of the birds was all right, but they had their own
families to look after, and besides, he could not always depend upon
having them near.</p>

<p>It was natural that he should be a bit homesick and lonely without other
rabbits to associate with. He often thought of Jimsy and Wheedles, and
of his mother and of Topsy. Any one of them would be welcome. In his
newly-acquired knowledge of the woods and its inhabitants, he felt that
he could give Jimsy and Wheedles pointers that would make their eyes
open.</p>

<p>When he reached the big rock, he hopped all around it, looking for the
entrance to the rabbit burrow, and sniffing the ground expectantly.
There were many signs that rabbits had recently been there, but he could
find nothing that looked like a burrow. Around and around the big rock
he hopped, sniffing, pounding with his hind feet, and calling to his
cousins. But there was no response.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they're all out," he reflected finally, "and I'd better rest on
the top of the rock until they return."</p>

<p>He scrambled to the summit of the rock and sprawled out full length to
watch and wait. From his high position, he could see any one approaching
from any direction. The sun found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> its way down through the trees and
lit up the top of the rock, and, feeling very tired, Bumper fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was aroused from this suddenly by the breaking of a twig near-by. He
raised his head and looked around. Not a dozen feet away from him was a
wild rabbit, one of his country cousins. Now, Bumper had never met a
wild rabbit before, and this one certainly looked very dirty and uncouth
compared to himself. The only white he had was under his throat and
belly. The rest of him was a dull gray and brown.</p>

<p>"Hello, Cousin!" Bumper called softly.</p>

<p>The approaching rabbit stopped and looked around, his two ears raised
straight up in the air. Then his quick eyes saw Bumper on the top of the
rock. Whether he took him for a ghost or some strange, dangerous animal,
no one could say; but he turned swiftly and disappeared in the bushes.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Cousin!" Bumper called loudly. "I'm Bumper the White
Rabbit, and I've come to visit you!"</p>

<p>But this had no effect whatever on the wild rabbit. Bumper could hear
him scurrying away in the bushes. Then all was quiet. For a long time
Bumper watched and waited. Once he caught a glimpse of his cousin on the
right of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> rock, then on the left, then behind, and again in front.
The amazing rapidity with which the wild rabbit changed his position
surprised Bumper.</p>

<p>It was not until after he had caught sight of two heads simultaneously
peeping above the bushes did he realize that the rabbit was not alone.
Then he caught sight of a third head, then of a fourth, and of a fifth.
The whole burrow of rabbits was circled around him, watching him either
in fear or curiosity. Bumper thought it was a good time to make a
speech.</p>

<p>"Cousins," he began, rearing upon his hind legs, "I've come a long
distance to visit you. I've always lived in the city, but I got lost,
and if it hadn't been for the birds and Buster the Bear I would never
have found my way here. I hope you will welcome me, and let me live with
you. I'm lonesome and homesick for friends and companions."</p>

<p>He supposed this speech would have a good effect, and he waited eagerly
for one of the wild rabbits to respond. But they were quiet for so long
that he felt despondent. Then, to his surprise, a big rabbit rose
near-by, and turned to his companions.</p>

<p>"Beware!" he said. "It's a trick of Mr. Fox! We must run for it
altogether!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Bumper didn't know just what the speaker meant by this last sentence.
But he soon found out. There was a rush and scramble in the bushes all
around him, and then a dozen or more rabbits appeared. They came toward
the rock like an army closing in upon the enemy, leaping over bushes or
crawling through the underbrush.</p>

<p>For a moment Bumper was startled. He had a vision of being attacked on
all sides by his country cousins and driven ignominiously from the
woods. But his anxiety was of short duration. The rabbits reached the
side of the rock, and disappeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>Then Bumper understood. They had made a simultaneous rush for their
burrow, knowing that this was the safest place for them. When the last
rabbit had disappeared, Bumper hopped down, and began looking for the
entrance. There was certainly an entrance to the burrow, or his cousins
couldn't have disappeared so quickly.</p>

<p>Bumper searched on every side for over an hour, but so artfully
concealed was the entrance to the burrow that he was unsuccessful. There
was no noise under the rock&mdash;nothing to indicate that there were rabbits
there.</p>

<p>Discouraged and down-hearted, he was nearly ready to give up when he
happened to poke his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> head in the hollow end of a tree whose roots were
pinioned down by the huge rock. The small heart of the trunk had
decayed, offering an entrance just large enough for a rabbit to squeeze
through.</p>

<p>Bumper thought this would be a safe place for him to spend the night,
and he began crawling through. The hole followed the trunk of the tree
downward for some distance. Then suddenly it turned sharply to the
right.</p>

<p>At this point Bumper met an unexpected challenge. A big, gray rabbit at
the other end of the hollow trunk thumped hard with his two hind feet,
and instantly there was an uproar. Bumper had accidentally found his way
into the burrow through the hollow tree trunk!</p>

<p>"Stop where you are!" the rabbit guarding the hole shouted. "What do you
want in here?"</p>

<p>"I want to greet my cousins. If you don't let me come in Mr. Fox will
catch me after dark. I have no other home."</p>

<p>"You're not a rabbit!" replied the other. "We have no white cousins.
There're no white rabbits in the world."</p>

<p>"But I'm one," returned Bumper, amused by the same cry that had been
made by the crow and birds.</p>

<p>There was silence inside, followed by a buzz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> of many voices. Finally a
weak, trembling voice said authoritatively:</p>

<p>"Admit him! It can't be Mr. Fox in disguise, for he could never crawl
through that hole. Admit him so I can talk to him."</p>

<p>Evidently the speaker was one in authority, for the other instantly
obeyed, and Bumper was allowed to hop through the hole into the burrow.</p>

<h2>STORY XVI<br/>BUMPER BECOMES THE WHITE KING OF THE RABBITS</h2>
</div>

<p>What Bumper saw and smelt when he hopped into the burrow under the rocks
made a great impression upon his mind. It was a large burrow directly
under the huge rock, with no other entrance to it than the one through
the hollow tree trunk. No wonder the fox couldn't reach the rabbits!
They were as well protected from him as if they lived in a house of
stone.</p>

<p>There were all sizes of rabbits around him&mdash;little ones scarcely able to
hop around without falling over, big, husky fellows with fierce looking
muzzles and eyes, and very old ones who seemed too feeble to move very
fast. But it was the one who had commanded the others to let Bumper in
that attracted his attention the most.</p>

<p>He had been a big, stalwart rabbit at one time, and his frame was still
large and angular, but age had shrunken his body and haunches, and his
cheeks were thin and wrinkled. The eyes stared straight at Bumper as
though they would go right through him. It was not until later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> that
Bumper understood it was blindness that made that stare seem so
penetrating.</p>

<p>"Tell me your name again!" this old patriarch said when Bumper stood
trembling before him.</p>

<p>"Bumper the White Rabbit!"</p>

<p>The old one hopped nearer, using one of his companions as a guide.</p>

<p>"Is it true," he asked finally, turning to the others, "that he's
white?"</p>

<p>"Yes," they all responded in chorus.</p>

<p>"No gray or brown hairs on him?"</p>

<p>"No gray or brown hairs on him."</p>

<p>"Be sure!" commanded the old leader. "Lick them to see if the gray shows
underneath."</p>

<p>Several obeyed this order, and Bumper felt as if he was being washed all
over, so vigorously did the tongues of his cousins lick him to discover
any fraud.</p>

<p>"He still remains white," one of the rabbits said finally. "There are no
gray or brown hairs underneath."</p>

<p>"That is well!" ejaculated the blind leader. "Now tell me the color of
his eyes."</p>

<p>"Pink!" they cried.</p>

<p>"Ah!" The blind rabbit seemed suddenly excited and trembled with
emotion. "Pure white, you say, and pink eyes! Is he a young rabbit, or
very, very old?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is young, no older than Piggy."</p>

<p>"Then it must be true," murmured the old blind patriarch. "It must be
true."</p>

<p>The others were all quiet, and waited for their wise, blind leader to
speak again. This he did after a long pause.</p>

<p>"Years ago," he began slowly, "there was a white rabbit who was sent to
us as a leader. He was the wisest and shrewdest and bravest of our kind.
Where he came from no one knew. We made him king, and he ruled wisely
and well for many years. He died before I was born, and that you know
was a long time ago. Before he died he told us that some day another
white rabbit, with pink eyes, would come to us, and his coming would be
as strange and unknown as his."</p>

<p>The speaker stopped and seemed to weigh his words. All the rabbits held
their breaths, and glanced from the blind leader to Bumper.</p>

<p>"When he came&mdash;this white rabbit, with pink eyes&mdash;we were to receive him
and make him our king and leader. His wisdom would be greater than that
of all ours combined, and in time he would deliver us from our enemies.
You know how it is with us in the woods here. We're the meekest and most
innocent of the wild animals. Even the birds prey upon us at times, and
Mr. Fox and Buster the Bear hold us in contempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> because we cannot
defend ourselves. We would live on friendly terms with all the wild
creatures of the woods, but they won't let us."</p>

<p>He sighed, and then continued: "Our only weapon is our teeth, but we
never use them except to chew our food. Yet they are as sharp as those
of the Squirrel, and nearly as long as those of the Fox. Yet we don't
know how to use them in defence, or if we do we're too timid to attempt
it. We're cowardly, and easily get frightened so that our enemies kill
us without danger to themselves. They all hold us in contempt here in
the woods."</p>

<p>This remarkable speech made many of the rabbits drop their heads in
dejection, for the truth of it was all too well known to them.</p>

<p>"But this new leader and king was to deliver us from our fear and
timidity," the blind speaker continued. "He was to show us how we could
make friends with all through his wisdom and foresight. We have been
waiting for him for many, many years, and now that he has come we should
be glad and joyful. Let us do homage to Bumper the White Rabbit, for he
is our new leader and king! I am happy to live to see the day come when
I could welcome him! My only regret is that age has blinded me, and I
cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> see him with my own eyes. I could die in peace then!"</p>

<p>With that the blind, old rabbit humbled himself before Bumper and kissed
one of his paws. This apparently was the signal for all the others to do
likewise. They came to him in turn, and promised to follow and obey his
word, secretly admiring his white fur and pink eyes.</p>

<p>To Bumper this sudden change of hostility to abject admiration and
worship was embarrassing. His mind was all in a whirl, and when the
others knelt before him and kissed his paw he could find no words to
say. He simply smiled as graciously as he could, and accepted the homage
in silence.</p>

<p>Without knowing it this was the correct thing to do. It was more
impressive than if he had protested or tried to explain that there was a
mistake. He was almost king-like in his attitude without trying to be
so.</p>

<p>It all seemed like a dream to him. He was led away to the choicest
sleeping part of the burrow, and attendants brought him food and drink.
There was always some one to wait on him no matter what he wanted to do.
It was slightly embarrassing at first, but, as the novelty of it wore
off he accepted the situation with a smile.</p>

<p>"If they take me for their king, why not act the part?" he asked
himself. "I believe I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> do it. I certainly look more like a king
than any of the others. And I'm prettier than any of my cousins."</p>

<p>Bumper was in danger of getting intolerably conceited, and for a time he
showed it; but his better sense came to his rescue finally.</p>

<p>"If I'm going to be their king and leader," he concluded, "I'll try to
be a wise and good one. I'll not disappoint them. I'll listen to Mr.
Blind Rabbit, and when I know all he does I'll try to use the knowledge
for the good of all the rabbits in the woods."</p>

<p>So Bumper the White Rabbit did not regret his loss of the red-headed
girl and the beautiful garden, for in becoming the king of the wild
rabbits he had a greater career before him, and how well he acquitted
himself in that position we shall see in future stories, in the book
entitled</p>

<p>"Bumper the White Rabbit in the Woods."</p>

<h2>WHITE TAIL'S ADVENTURES</h2>
<h2>STORY I</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="smcap">White Tail Jumps Stepping Stone Brook</span></p>

<p>White Tail grew rapidly in size and strength, his long, clean limbs
showing taut muscles and great springing power; and his neck grew thick
and short, which is well for a buck, who must use it in savage thrusts
when the head is a battering ram. His horns were short and bony, but
they protruded in front like knobs against which it would be unpleasant
to fall.</p>

<p>But his antlers were his pride. They spread out fan-shape on his head,
crowning it with a glory that made Mother Deer supremely happy. At times
it seemed as if the antlers were too heavy for the head and neck, but
White Tail carried them easily, and when he shook them in sport or anger
any one could see they were just fitted to him.</p>

<p>In time he stood as high as Father Buck, and a head taller than Mother
Deer. The day the tip of his antlers reached an inch above Father
Buck's, he felt a little thrill of pride.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span class="smcap">Washer's First Adventure</span></p>

<p>Washer was the youngest of a family of three Raccoons, born in the woods
close to the shores of Beaver Pond, and not half a mile from Rocky Falls
where the water, as you know, turns into silvery spray that sparkles in
the sun-shine like diamonds and rubies. And, indeed, the animals and
birds of the North Woods much prefer this glittering spray and foam that
rise in a steady cloud from the bottom of the falls to all the jewels
and gems ever dug out of the earth! For, though each drop sparkles but a
moment, and then vanishes from sight, there are a million others to
follow it, and when you bathe in them they wash and scour away the dirt,
and make you clean and fresh in body and soul.</p>

<p>Washer had his first great adventure at Rocky Falls, and it is a wonder
that he ever lived to tell the tale, for the water which flows over the

<p>High among the timberland of the North Woods White Tail the Deer was
born, and if you had stumbled upon his home in the thickets you would
have been surprised by a noise like the rushing of the wind, and then by
a very remarkable silence that could almost be felt. The first was made
by Mother White Tail as she deserted her young and took to quick flight.</p>

<p>White Tail, crouching low down in the bushes, so still that he scarcely
moved a hair, would hide his beautiful head in the branches and leaves
like an obedient child. Left alone he knew that his one chance of escape
was not to move or whimper or cry.</p>

<p>That was the first lesson White Tail was taught by his mother&mdash;to keep
absolutely quiet in the presence of danger. When he was so small that he
could hardly hold up his head, she whispered to him: "Listen, White

<p>In the North Woods where Buster was born, a wide river tinkles merrily
over stones that are so white you'd mistake them for snowballs, if you
were not careful, and begin pelting each other with them. The birches
hanging over the water look like white sticks of peppermint candy,
except in the spring of the year when they blossom out in green leaves,
and then they make you think of fairyland where everything is painted
the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>The rocks that slope up from the bank of the river are dented and broken
as if some giant in the past had smashed them with his hammer, cracking
some and punching deep holes in others. It was in one of these holes, or
caves, that Buster was born.</p>

<p>He didn't mind the hard rocky floor of his bed a bit, nor did he mind
the darkness, nor the cold winds that swept through the open doorway. He
was so well protected by his...</p>

<h2>STORY I</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="smcap">Bumper and Sleepy the Opossum</span></p>

<p>Bumper, after working hard to trick his enemies so they would be more
afraid of the rabbits in the woods, had decided the ways of peace were
better than those of war. Not that he was going to permit Sneaky the
Wolf or Loup the Lynx to pounce upon his people and eat them up without
fighting, but instead of going around with a chip on his shoulder,
expecting and looking for trouble, he intended to make friends of all
the animals and birds, and be helpful to them.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how much good to others we can overlook if we go about
with our eyes shut. There is plenty to do if we look for it. So Bumper
found in a short time that he had missed a good deal in always looking
for the worst in others instead of for the best.</p>

<p>Only a few days after his change of plans, which was told of in a former
book, Bumper stumbled upon Sleepy the Opossum in a tree, with his eyes
closed in slumber. At first he...</p>

<h2>BOBBY GRAY SQUIRREL</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="smcap">Bobby's Introduction</span></p>

<p>There are many squirrels living in the North Woods, but only one real
Bobby Gray Squirrel, and if you saw him once you would never mistake him
for any other. Bobby was a gay, rollicking happy-go-lucky fellow, who
believed in enjoying himself to-day and letting the morrow take care of
itself. He wasn't exactly lazy, but he didn't believe in doing work that
wasn't actually necessary, and sometimes, I'm afraid, he forgot to do
what was really necessary.</p>

<p>Bobby had many friends in the woods, and they all liked him and smiled
at him, but there were some who thought his careless ways might get him
in trouble some day. So instead of chattering pleasantly with him, they
shook their heads and preached to him.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get busy these pleasant days, Bobby, and store up food
for the winter?" Gray Back the Weasel asked reprovingly one bright,
sunny day.</p>

<p>Bumper the White Rabbit, when he escaped from Edith, the red-headed girl
who owned the garden where he lived, found his way into the woods, and,
after many adventures with the Bats, the Crow, the Fox and Buster the
Bear, he was adopted by the wild rabbits as their leader and king. The
Old Blind Rabbit welcomed him, and told the story of how it was
prophesied that some day a pure white rabbit, with pink eyes, would come
to deliver them from their enemies, and teach them how to live in the
woods without fear of danger.</p>

<p>No one had been more surprised than Bumper at this sudden welcome. At

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
